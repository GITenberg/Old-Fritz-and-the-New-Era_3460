    <h2>
      FOREWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      I would merely say a few words in justification of the Historical Romance,
      in its relation to history. Any one, with no preceding profound study of
      history, who takes a few well-known historical facts as a foundation for
      an airy castle of romantic invention and fantastic adventure, may easily
      write an Historical Romance; for him history is only the nude manikin
      which he clothes and adorns according to his own taste, and to which he
      gives the place and position most agreeable to himself. But only the
      writer who is in earnest with respect to historical truth, who is not
      impelled by levity or conceited presumption, is justified in attempting
      this species of composition; thoroughly impressed with the greatness of
      his undertaking, he will with modest humility constantly remember that he
      has proposed to himself a great and sublime work which, however, it will
      be difficult if not impossible for him wholly and completely to
      accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is this great, this sublime end, which the Historical Romance
      writer proposes to attain? It is this: to illustrate history, to
      popularize it; to bring forth from the silent studio of the scholar and to
      expose in the public market of life, for the common good, the great men
      and great deeds embalmed in history, and of which only the studious have
      hitherto enjoyed the monopoly. Thus, at least, have I considered the
      vocation I have chosen, not vainly or inconsiderately, but with a profound
      conviction of the greatness of my undertaking, and with a depressing
      consciousness that my power and acquirements may prove inadequate for the
      attainment of my proposed end.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I am also fully conscious of what was and still is my greatest desire:
      to give an agreeable and popular form to our national history, which may
      attract the attention and affections of our people, which may open their
      understandings to the tendencies of political movements, and connect the
      facts of history with the events of actual life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The severe historian has to do but with accomplished facts; he can only
      record and describe, with the strictest regard to truth, that which has
      outwardly occurred. He describes the battles of peoples, the struggles of
      nations, the great deeds of heroes, the actions of princes&mdash;in short,
      he gives the accomplished facts. To investigate and explain the secret
      motives, the hidden causes of these facts, to present them in connection
      with all that impelled to them, this is the task of Historical Romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The historian presents to you the outward face, the external form of
      history; Historical Romance would show you the heart of history, and thus
      bring near to your heart what, else, would stand so far off. To enable him
      to do this, the writer of an Historical Romance must, indeed, make severe
      and various studies. He must devote his whole mind and soul to the epoch
      he would illustrate, he must live in it and feel with it. He must so
      familiarize himself with all the details, as in a manner to become a child
      of that epoch; for he can present a really living image of only that which
      is living in himself. That this requires a deep and earnest study of
      history is self-evident. Historical Romance demands the study of the
      historian, together with the creative imagination of the poet. For the
      free embodiment of the poet can blossom only from out the studio of the
      historian, as the flower from the seed; as, by a reciprocal organic
      action, the hyacinth is derived from the onion, and the rose from its
      seed-capsule, so are history and poetry combined in the Historical
      Romance, giving and receiving life to and from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Historical Romance has its great task and its great justification&mdash;a
      truth disputed by only those who either have not understood or will not
      understand its nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Historical Romance has, if I may be allowed so to speak, four several
      objects for which to strive:
    </p>
    <p>
      Its first object is, to throw light upon the dark places of history,
      necessarily left unclear by the historian. Poetry has the right and duty
      of setting facts in a clear light, and of illuminating the darkness by its
      sunny beams. The poetry of the romance writer seeks to deduce historical
      characteristics from historical facts, and to draw from the spirit of
      history an elucidation of historical characters, so that the writer may be
      able to detect their inmost thoughts and feelings, and in just and sharp
      traits to communicate them to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second task of Historical Romance is, to group historical characters
      according to their internal natures, and thus to elucidate and illustrate
      history. This illustration then leads to the third task, which is the
      discovery and exposition of the motives which impel individual historical
      personages to the performance of great historical acts, and from
      outwardly, apparently insignificant events in their lives to deduce their
      inmost thoughts and natures, and represent them clearly to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thence follows the fourth task: the illustration of historical facts by a
      romance constructed in the spirit of the history. This fourth and
      principal task is the presentation of history in a dramatic form and with
      animated descriptions; upon the foundation of history to erect the temple
      of poesy, which must nevertheless be pervaded and illuminated by historic
      truth. From this it naturally follows that it is of very little
      consequence whether the personages of the Historical Romance actually
      spoke the words or performed the acts attributed to them; it is only
      necessary that those words and deeds should be in accordance with the
      spirit and character of such historical personages, and that the writer
      should not attribute to them what they could not have spoken or done. In
      the Historical Romance, when circumstances or events are presented in
      accordance with historical tradition, when the characters are naturally
      described, they bear with them their own justification, and Historical
      Romance has need of no further defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historical Romance should be nothing but an illustration of history. If
      the drawing, grouping, coloring, and style of such an illustration of any
      given historical epoch are admitted to be true, then the illustration
      rises to the elevation of a work of art, worthy of a place beside the
      historical picture, and is equally useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raphael&rsquo;s &ldquo;School of Athens,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Institution of the Communion,&rdquo; and many
      others of his pictures, are such illustrations of history&mdash;as also
      the great paintings of Rubens from the life of Anna dei Medici; and then
      the historical pictures of Horace Vernet, of Delaroche, of Lessing, and of
      Kaulbach&mdash;all these are illustrations of history. What those artists
      present and illustrate with paint and pencil, the Historical Romancer
      represents in words with his pen; and when he does this successfully, he
      will live in the memory of his reader as imperishably as the great
      historical pictures of the painters in the memory of their beholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would occur to no one to accuse a successful historical picture of
      falsehood, because the books of history do not show that the occurrence
      took place precisely in the manner represented, that the historical
      personages really so laughed or wept, or so deported themselves. If the
      situation and grouping of historical events are allowed to be in
      accordance with the general tenor of history, then the picture may be
      pronounced historically true, and is just as good a piece of history as
      the record of the special historian. It is the same with the pictures of
      the romancer as with those of the painter; and this is my answer to those
      who, on every occasion, are continually asking: &ldquo;Was it really thus? Did
      it really occur in that manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Show me from history that it could not be so; that it is not in accordance
      with the character of the persons represented&mdash;then I will confess
      that I am wrong, and you are right; then have I not presented an
      illustration, but only a caricature of history, faulty as a work of art,
      and wanting the dignity of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am conscious of having earnestly and devotedly striven for the truth,
      and of having diligently sought it in all attainable historical works. The
      author of an Historical Romance has before him a difficult task: while he
      must falsify nothing in history, he must poetize it in a manner that both
      historical and poetic truth shall be the result. To those, however, who so
      very severely judge Historical Romance, and would deny its historical
      worth, I now, in conclusion, answer with the following significant
      quotation from Schiller:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall always prove a bad resource for any future historian who may have
      the misfortune to recur to me. History is generally only a magazine for my
      fantasy, and objects must be contented with whatever they may become under
      my hand.&rdquo;&mdash;(See Weisnar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Musenhof,&rdquo; p. 93.)
    </p>
    <p>
      This declaration of Schiller satisfies me with respect to the nature of my
      own creations. I desire not to be a resource for historical writers, but I
      shall always earnestly and zealously seek to draw from the wells of
      history, that nothing false or unreal may find a place in the &ldquo;magazine of
      my fantasy.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I. THE LONELY KING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so let it be!&rdquo; said the king, sighing, as he rose from his
      arm-chair; &ldquo;I must go forth to the strife, and these old limbs must again
      submit to the fatigue of war. But what matters it? The life of princes is
      passed in the fulfilment of duties and responsibilities, and rarely is it
      gladdened with the sunny rays of joy and peace! Let us submit!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let us submit!&rdquo; repeated the king, thoughtfully, slowly pacing his
      cabinet back and forth, his hands folded upon his staff behind him, and
      his favorite dog, Alkmene, sleepily following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a melancholy picture to see this bowed-down old man; his thin, pale
      face shaded by a worn-out, three-cornered hat, his dirty uniform strewn
      with snuff; and his meagre legs encased in high-topped, unpolished boots;
      his only companion a greyhound, old and joyless as his master. Neither the
      bust of Voltaire, with its beaming, intelligent face, nor those of his
      friends, Lord-Marshal Keith and the Marquis d&rsquo;Argens, could win an
      affectionate glance from the lonely old king. He whom Europe distinguished
      as the Great Frederick, whom his subjects called their &ldquo;father and
      benefactor,&rdquo; whose name was worthy to shine among the brightest stars of
      heaven, his pale, thin lips just murmured, &ldquo;Resignation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With downcast eyes he paced his cabinet, murmuring, &ldquo;Let us submit!&rdquo; He
      would not look up to those who were gazing down upon him from the walls&mdash;to
      those who were no more. The remembrance of them unnerved him, and filled
      his heart with grief. The experiences of life, and the ingratitude of men,
      had left many a scar upon this royal heart, but had never hardened it; it
      was still overflowing with tender sympathy and cherished memories. To
      Lord-Marshal Keith, Marquis d&rsquo;Argens, and Voltaire, Frederick owed the
      happiest years of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      D&rsquo;Argens, who passionately loved Frederick, had been dead five years;
      Lord-Marshal Keith one month; and Voltaire was dying! This intelligence
      the king had received that very morning, from his Paris correspondent,
      Grimm. It was this that filled his heart with mourning. The face, that
      smiled so full of intelligence, was perhaps distorted with agony, and
      those beaming eyes were now closing in death!
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire was dying!
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederick&rsquo;s thoughts were with the dead and dying&mdash;with the past! He
      recalled, when crown prince at Rheinsberg, how much he had admired, loved,
      and distinguished Voltaire; how he rejoiced, and how honored he felt,
      when, as a young king, Voltaire yielded to his request to live with him at
      Berlin. This intimacy, it is true, did not long continue; the king was
      forced to recognize, with bitter regret, that the MAN Voltaire was not
      worthy the love which he bestowed upon the POET. He renounced the MAN, but
      the poet was still his admiration; and all the perfidy, slander and malice
      of Voltaire, had never changed Frederick. The remembrance of it had long
      since faded from his noble heart&mdash;only the memory of the poet, of the
      author of so many hours of the purest enjoyment, remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire was dying!
    </p>
    <p>
      This great and powerful spirit, who so long a time, in the natural body,
      had instructed, inspired, and refreshed mankind, would leave that body to
      rise&mdash;whither?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immortality, what art thou?&rdquo; asked the king, aloud, and for the first
      time raising his eyes with an inquiring glance to the busts of his
      friends. &ldquo;I have sought for thee, I have toiled for thee, my whole life
      long! Neither the researches of the learned, nor the subtleties of
      philosophy reveal thee to me. Is there any other immortality than fame?
      Any other eternal life than that which the memory of succeeding
      generations grants to the dead?&rdquo; In this tone of thought Frederick
      recited, audibly, the conclusion of a poem, which he had addressed to
      D&rsquo;Alembert:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have consecrated my days to philosophy, I admit all the innocent
      pleasures of life; And knowing that soon my course will finish, I enjoy
      the present with fear of the future. What is there to fear after death? If
      the body and the mind suffer the same fate, I shall return and mingle with
      nature; If a remnant of my intellectual fire escapes death, I will flee to
      the arms of my God.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: Posthumous works, vol. vii., p.88.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And may this soon be granted me!&rdquo; continued the king; &ldquo;then I shall be
      reunited to those loved ones&mdash;gone before. I must be content to tarry
      awhile in this earthly vale of sorrow, and finish the task assigned me by
      the Great Teacher; therefore, let us submit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sighed; pacing to and fro, his steps were arrested at a side-table,
      where lay a long black velvet box; it contained the flute that his beloved
      teacher, Quantz, had made for him. Frederick had always kept it in his
      cabinet as a memento of his lost friend; as this room he had devoted to a
      temple of Memory&mdash;of the past!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another of the joys, another of the stars of my life vanished!&rdquo; murmured
      the king. &ldquo;My charming concerts are at an end! Quantz, Brenda, and my
      glorious Graun are no more. While they are listening to the heavenly
      choir, I must be content with the miserable, idle chatter of men; the
      thunder of battle deafening my ears, to which that mad, ambitious Emperor
      of Austria hopes to force me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the king thus soliloquized, he involuntarily drew from the box the
      beautiful ebony flute, exquisitely ornamented with silver. A smile played
      around his delicate mouth. He raised the flute to his lips, and a
      melancholy strain floated through the stillness&mdash;the king&rsquo;s requiem
      to the dead, his farewell to the dying!
    </p>
    <p>
      No sound of the outer world penetrated that lonely room. The guard of
      honor, on duty upon the Sans-Souci terrace, halted suddenly, as the sad
      music fell upon his ear. The fresh spring breeze swept through the trees,
      and drove the laden-blossomed elder-bushes tapping against the
      windowpanes, as if to offer a May-greeting to the lonely king. The servant
      in waiting stole on tiptoe to the door of the anteroom, listening
      breathlessly at the key-hole to the moving melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Alkmene suddenly raised her head as if something unusual were taking
      place, fixed her great eyes upon her master, jumping upon his knee, and
      resting her fore-paws lovingly upon his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederick neither observed nor felt the movement of his favorite; his
      thoughts were absent from the present&mdash;absent from the earth! They
      were wandering in the unknown future, with the spirits of those he longed
      to see again in the Elysian fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wailing music of his flute expressed the lamentation of his soul, and
      his eyes filled with tears as he raised them to the bust of Voltaire,
      gazing at it with a look of pain until the melody was finished. Then
      abruptly turning, half unwillingly, half angrily, he returned the flute to
      the box, and stole away, covering his face with his hands, as if to hide
      his emotion from himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we have finished with the dead, and the living claim our thoughts,&rdquo;
       sighed the king. &ldquo;What an absurd thing is the human heart! It will never
      grow cold or old; always pretending to a spark of the fire which that
      shameful fellow Prometheus stole from the gods. What an absurdity! What
      have I, an old fellow, to do with the fire of Prometheus, when the fire of
      war will soon rage around me,&rdquo; At this instant the door gently opened.
      &ldquo;What do you want, Muller? What do you poke your stupid face in here for?&rdquo;
       said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, your majesty,&rdquo; replied the footman, &ldquo;the Baron von Arnim begs
      for an audience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bid him enter,&rdquo; commanded the king, sinking back in his old, faded velvet
      arm-chair. Resting his chin upon his staff, he signed to the baron, who
      stood bowing upon the threshold, to approach. &ldquo;Well, Arnim, what is the
      matter? What papers have you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; answered Baron von Arnim, &ldquo;the contract of the French actors,
      which needs renewing, I have to lay before your majesty; also a paper,
      received yesterday, from Madame Mara; still another from the singer
      Conciliani, and a petition from four persons from the opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What stupid stuff!&rdquo; growled the king, at the same time bestowing a caress
      upon Alkmene. &ldquo;Commence with your report. Let us hear what those singers
      are now asking for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The singer Conciliani has addressed a heart-breaking letter to your
      majesty, and prays for an increase of salary&mdash;that it is impossible
      for him to live upon three thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is what is wanted?&rdquo; cried the king, furious, and striking his
      staff upon the floor. &ldquo;The fellow is mad; When he cannot live upon three
      thousand, he will not be able to live upon four. I want money for cannon.
      I cannot spend it for such nonsense. I am surprised, Von Arnim that you
      repeat such stuff to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, it is my duty that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Your duty is not to flatter them. I pay them to give me pleasure,
      not presumption. Remember, once for all, do not flatter them. Conciliani
      will get no increase of salary. If he persists, let him go to the
      mischief! This is my decision.&mdash;Proceed! What is Madame Mara begging
      for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madame Mara constantly refuses to sing the airs which your majesty
      commanded to be introduced into the opera of &lsquo;Coriolanus.&rsquo; She has taken
      the liberty to address you in writing; here is the letter, if your majesty
      will have the grace to read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means, sir, by no means!&rdquo; cried the king; at the same instant
      catching the paper with his staff, he slung it like a shot arrow to the
      farthest corner of the room, to the great amusement of Alkmene, who, with
      a loud bark, sprang from her master&rsquo;s knee, and with a bound caught the
      strange bird, and tore it in pieces. &ldquo;You are right, my pet,&rdquo; said the
      king, laughing, &ldquo;you have written my answer with your nose to this
      arrogant person. Director, say to Madame Mara that I pay her to sing, not
      to write. She must sing both airs, or she may find herself at Spandau for
      her obstinacy, where her husband is, for the same reason. She can reflect,
      and judge for herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The director could scarcely repress a sigh, foreboding the disagreeable
      scene that he would have to encounter with the proud and passionate
      singer. Timidly Von Arnim alluded to the four persons from the opera. &ldquo;Who
      are these demoiselles, and what do they want?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied the Baron von Arnim, &ldquo;they are the four persons who
      personate the role of court ladies and maids of honor to the queens and
      princesses. They beg your majesty to secure to them a fixed income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Go to my writing-table and bring paper and pencil; I will dictate
      a reply to them,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Now write, Von Arnim: &lsquo;To the four court
      ladies and maids of honor of the opera: You are mistaken in addressing
      yourselves to me; the affair of your salaries concerns YOUR emperors and
      kings. To them you must address yourselves.&mdash;Adieu.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Von Arnim could scarcely repress a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now we come to the last affair&mdash;the salaries and pensions of the
      French actors,&rdquo; said the king; &ldquo;but first tell me the news in Berlin&mdash;what
      report has trumpeted forth in the last few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, the latest news in Berlin, which rumor brings home to every
      hearth-side and every heart is, that your majesty has declared war with
      Austria on account of the Bavarian succession. Every one rejoices, sire,
      that you will humble that proud and supercilious house of Austria, and
      enter the lists for Germany.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; answered the king, sternly. &ldquo;I did not ask you to blow the
      trumpet of praise, as if your honor, inspector of the theatres, thought
      yourself upon the stage, and would commence a comedy with the king of
      lamps. So it is known then that my soldiers will enter the great theatre
      of war, and that we are about to fight real battles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is known, sire,&rdquo; replied Von Arnim, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what I am about to communicate to you will not surprise you. The
      present juncture of affairs leads us to await very grave scenes&mdash;we
      can well dispense with comedy. I withdraw the salaries and pensions of the
      French actors&mdash;your own is included. After you have dismissed the
      French comedians, you will be entirely at leisure to pursue your
      love-intrigues.&mdash;Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; cried the baron, amazed, &ldquo;has your highness dismissed me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you deaf, or have you some of the cotton in your ears which I
      presented to you at your recall from Copenhagen?&rdquo; replied the king. <i>[Footnote:
      Baron von Arnim was ambassador to Copenhagen until 1754, when he begged
      for his recall, stating that the damp climate was injurious to his health.
      The king granted his request, and the baron returned to Berlin. At the
      first audience with the king, Frederick handed Baron von Arnim a
      carefully-packed box, saying, &ldquo;I do not wish the government to lose so
      valuable a servant; in this box you will find something that will keep you
      warm.&rdquo; Arnim could scarcely await his return home, to open the box; it
      contained nothing but cotton. Some days afterward, however, the king
      increased Von Arnim&rsquo;s income a thousand dollars, and sent him ambassador
      to Dresden. Von Arnim was afterward director of the Royal Theatre until
      dismissed in the above manner.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I have heard all, but I cannot believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; interrupted the king, &ldquo;To believe is difficult; you, I
      presume, never belonged to the pious and believing. Your intrigues would
      not admit of it; but now you have the leisure to pursue them with a right
      good-will. You have only to discharge, as I have said, the entire French
      troupe, and the whole thing is done with.&mdash;Adieu, Arnim, may you be
      prospered!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baron von Arnim muttered some incomprehensible words, and retreated from
      the royal presence. The door had scarcely closed, when it was again opened
      without ceremony by a young man, wearing a gold-laced dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; said he, hastily, in an undertone, &ldquo;your majesty, she has
      just gone to the Palace Park, just the same hour she went yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she alone?&rdquo; asked the king, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she is not alone; at a little distance the nurse follows with the
      princely infant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king cast an angry glance at the saucy, laughing face of the young
      man, who at once assumed a devoted, earnest mien. &ldquo;Has your majesty any
      further commands?&rdquo; asked he, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I command you to hold your tongue until you are spoken to!&rdquo; replied the
      king, harshly. &ldquo;You understand spying and hanging about, as you have good
      ears, a quick eye, and a keen scent. I therefore make use of you, because
      I need a spy; but, understand that a fellow who allows himself to be used
      as a spy, is, indeed, a useful subject, but generally a worthless one, and
      to whom it is becoming to be modest and humble. I am now going to Berlin;
      you will accompany me. Take off your finery, so that every one may not
      recognize at once the peacock by his feathers. Go to the taverns and
      listen to what they say about the war; whether the people are much
      dissatisfied about it. Keep your great ears wide open, and bring me this
      evening all the latest news. Go, now, tell my coachman to be ready; in
      half an hour I shall set off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man slunk away to the door, but stood without opening it, his
      head down, and his under-lip hanging out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the king, in a milder tone, &ldquo;why do you not
      go, Kretzschmar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot go away if your majesty is angry with me,&rdquo; muttered the servant,
      insolently. &ldquo;I do not wish to hear or see any thing more for you when your
      majesty abuses me, and considers me such a mean, base fellow. Your majesty
      first commanded me to listen, and spy, and now that I am obeying, I am
      despised and scolded for it. I will have nothing more to do with it, and I
      wish your majesty to leave me a simple footman rather than to accord me
      such a mean position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean so badly,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;I mean well enough for you; but
      you must not permit yourself to be arrogant or disrespectful, otherwise
      you may go to Tophet! You are no common spy, you are listening about a
      little because you know I am fond of hearing what the people are saying,
      and what is going on in Berlin and Potsdam. But take care that they know
      nothing about it, otherwise they will be careful, and you will hear
      nothing. Now be off, and in order to see a cheerful face on you, I will
      make you a present.&rdquo; The king drew from his vest-pocket a purse, well
      filled with small coin, and gave it to the young man, who took it, though
      he still looked angry and insolent. &ldquo;Do not let your under-lip hang down
      so, for I may step upon it,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Put the money in your pocket,
      and hurry off to tell old Pfund to harness quickly, or I shall not arrive
      in time at the park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no danger, your majesty, for the miss seems very fond of the
      promenade; she remained two hours in the park yesterday, always walking in
      the most quiet places, as if she were afraid to meet any one. She sat a
      whole hour on the iron seat by the Carp Pond, and then she went to the
      Philosopher&rsquo;s Walk, and skipped about like a young colt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very cunning fellow, and know how to use your eyes well,&rdquo; said
      the king. &ldquo;Now be off, and order the carriage.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II. WILHELMINE ENKE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Palace Park was as quiet and deserted as usual. Not a voice, not a
      sound, disturbed the stillness of those silent walks. For this reason,
      undoubtedly, a young lady had sought it; at least her whole being
      expressed satisfaction and delight to wander unobserved through those
      quiet, shady alleys. She was of slight and elegant proportions, simply
      attired, without pretension, in a dark dress of some thin silk material.
      Her black silk mantle was thrown aside upon the stone seat near her,
      uncovering thus, in solitude, to the sun and birds, her lovely neck and
      arms, the beauty of which might rival the statues of the ancients. Her
      face was not of regular beauty, yet it possessed that expression of grace,
      spirit, and energy, which is oftener a more powerful and more enduring
      charm than regular beauty. Her large, expressive black eyes possessed a
      wonderful power, and her red, pouting lips wore a sweet smile; her fine
      Roman nose lent an air of decision, whilst her high-arched forehead led
      one to believe that daring, energetic thought lay hidden beneath those
      clusters of brown curls. She was not in the bloom of youth, but at
      twenty-five she appeared younger than many beauties at eighteen; and if
      her form no longer possessed the charm of girlhood, it was attractive from
      its suppleness and full, beautiful bust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louisa, Louisa, where are you?&rdquo; cried the young lady, stepping quickly
      forward toward a side-path, which led from the broad avenue, and at the
      end of which was a sunny grassplot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am, miss; I am coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss,&rdquo; murmured the young lady, &ldquo;how dreadfully it sounds! The blush of
      shame rises to my face, for it sounds like bitter mockery and contempt,
      and brings my whole life before me. Yet, I must endure it&mdash;and I
      scarcely wish it were otherwise. Ah, there you are, Louisa, and there is
      my beautiful boy,&rdquo; she cried, with a glad voice, hastening toward the
      peasant-woman and bending fondly over her child. &ldquo;How beautiful and how
      knowing he looks! It seems as if my little Alexander began to recognize me&mdash;he
      looks so earnest and sensible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows you, miss,&rdquo; said the nurse, courtesying, &ldquo;and he knows, like
      other children, who loves him. Children and dogs know who love them. The
      children cry, and the dogs hide themselves when people are around who
      dislike them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Louisa!&rdquo; laughed the young lady, as she bent to kiss her child&mdash;&ldquo;nonsense!
      did not my little boy cry when his father took him yesterday? And he loves
      his child most tenderly, as only a father can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there is another reason for that,&rdquo; said the nurse. &ldquo;He has just
      passed his first stupid three months, and he begins to hear and see what
      passes around him, and it was the first man&rsquo;s face that he had seen. But
      only look, miss, what a beautiful little dog is coming up the path.&rdquo; It
      was indeed a lovely greyhound, of the small Italian race, which came
      bounding joyfully toward them, and as he saw the woman barked loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, Alkmene, be quiet!&rdquo; cried a loud, commanding voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Heaven! it is the king!&rdquo; whispered the young lady, turning pale, and,
      as if stunned, retreated a few steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is really the king,&rdquo; cried the nurse, &ldquo;and he is coming directly
      from the grass-plot here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go as quickly as possible, Louisa. Come, come,&rdquo; and she hastily
      threw her mantle around her, drawing the hood over her curly head. She had
      only proceeded a few steps, when a loud voice bade her to remain&mdash;to
      stand still. She stood as if rooted to the spot, leaning upon her nurse
      for support; her knees sank under her, and it seemed as if the whole world
      turned around with her. After the first tumult of anxiety and fear,
      succeeded an insolent determination, and, forcing herself to calmness, she
      said: &ldquo;It is the turning-point of my life; the next few minutes will
      either crush me or assure my future; let me struggle for the future, then.
      I will face him who approaches me as my judge.&rdquo; Forcing herself to
      composure, slowly and with effort she turned toward the king, who,
      approaching by the side path, had entered the avenue, and now stood before
      her. But as she encountered the fiery glance of the king&rsquo;s eye, she
      quailed before it, casting down her own, covered with confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; demanded the king, with stern authority, keeping his eagle
      eye fixed upon her. Silent and immovable she stood; only the quick,
      feverish breathing and the heaving bosom told the storm that was raging
      within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; repeated the voice, with still more severity&mdash;&ldquo;who
      permit themselves to use my park as a nursery? What child is that? and who
      are its parents? They should be of high position at court, who would dare
      to send their child and nurse to the royal park; and with what joy they
      must regard the offspring of their conjugal tenderness! Tell me to whom
      does this child belong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sobbing convulsively, the lady sank, kneeling, with uplifted arms,
      imploring for mercy. &ldquo;Sire, annihilate me with your anger, but do not
      crush me with your scorn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What language do you permit yourself to hold?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it is the language of an unhappy, despairing woman, who knows that
      she stands before that great monarch whose judgment she fears more than
      that of her God, who sees into her heart, and reads the tortures and
      reproaches of her conscience; who knows what she suffers, and knows, also,
      that she is free from self-interest, and every base desire. I believe that
      God will forgive what I fear your majesty will not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak presumptuously, and remind me of the theatre princesses who
      represent a grand scene with a pathetic exit. Let me inform you, I despise
      comedians&mdash;only high tragedy pleases me. Spare yourself the trouble
      to act before me, but answer me&mdash;who are you? Whose child is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, only God and my king should hear my reply&mdash;I beg the favor to
      send away the nurse and child.&rdquo; The king assented, slightly nodding his
      head, at the same time bidding her not to kneel to him as to an image.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady rose and sought the nurse, who, from fright, had withdrawn into
      the shrubbery, and stood staring at the king with wide-open eyes. &ldquo;Go
      home, Louisa, and put the child to sleep,&rdquo; said she, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nurse obeyed promptly, and when alone, the king demanded again, &ldquo;Who
      are you? and to whom does the child belong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, I am the daughter of your chapel musician Enke, and the
      child is the son of Prince Frederick William of Prussia,&rdquo; she replied, in
      a firm and defiant manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s eyes flashed as he glanced at the bold speaker. &ldquo;You say so,
      but who vouches for the truth of it? You permit yourself to use a high
      name, to give your child an honorable father! What temerity! what
      presumption! What if I should not believe you, but send you to the house
      of correction, at Spandau, as a slanderer, as guilty of high-treason, as a
      sinner and an adulteress?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could not do it, sire&mdash;you could not,&rdquo; cried Wilhelmine Enke,
      &ldquo;for you would also send there the honor and the name of your successor to
      the throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried the king, furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, your majesty, that the prince has holy duties toward me. I am the
      mother of that child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You acknowledge your shame, and you dare confess it to me, your king,
      that you are the favorite, the kept mistress of the Prince of Prussia, who
      has already a wife that has borne him children? You do not even seek to
      deny it, or to excuse yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would try to excuse myself, did I not feel that your majesty would not
      listen to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What excuse could you offer?&mdash;there is none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love is my excuse,&rdquo; cried Wilhelmine, eagerly. &ldquo;Oh! my ruler and king, do
      not shake your noble head so unbelievingly; do not look at me so
      contemptuously. Oh, Father in heaven, I implore Thee to quicken my mind,
      that my thoughts may become words, and my lips utter that which is burning
      in my soul! In all these years of my poor, despised, obscure life, how
      often have I longed for this hour when I might stand before my king, when
      I might penitently clasp his knees and implore mercy for myself and my
      children&mdash;those poor, nameless beings, whose existence is my
      accusation, and yet who are the pride and joy of my life! Oh, sire, I will
      not accuse, to excuse myself; I will not cast the stone at others which
      they have cast at me. But it is scarcely charitable to judge and condemn a
      young girl fourteen years of age, who did but obey the command of her
      parents, and followed the man who was the first and only one that ever
      whispered the word of love in her ear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have heard that your parents sold their child to shame. Is it true?&rdquo;
       cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, my father was poor; the scanty income of a chapel musician scarcely
      sufficed to educate and support four children. The prince promised my
      father to educate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! The promises of a young man of twenty-five are made without
      reflection, and rarely ever fulfilled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, to the Prince of Prussia I owe all that I know, and all that I am;
      his promise to my dying father was fully redeemed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, by whom were you taught, and what have you learned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, the prince wished, before all, that I should learn to speak
      French. Madame Girard was my French instructress, and taught me to play
      the guitar and spinet also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I presume you have learned to jabber a little French and drum a
      little music,&rdquo; said the king, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, sire; I have a tolerable knowledge of history and of
      geography. I am familiar with the ancient and modern poets. I have read a
      good French translation of Homer, Horace, and Virgil, with a master. I
      have studied the history of Brandenburg, of Germany, and of America. We
      have read the immortal works of Voltaire, of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and of
      Shakespeare, with many of our modern poets. My instructor has read all
      these works aloud to me, and he was much pleased when I repeated parts of
      what he had read to me some days afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appear to have had a very learned instructor,&rdquo; remarked the king,
      sneeringly. &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name, sire, is Prince Frederick William of Prussia. Yes, it is he who
      has taught me&mdash;he who has made me an intelligent woman. However young
      he was when he undertook the task, he has accomplished it with fidelity,
      firmness, and patience. He loved me, and would make me worthy of him, in
      heart and mind. I shall ever be grateful to him, and only death can
      extinguish the love and esteem with which he in spires me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I command you to leave the prince? Suppose I will no longer
      endure the scandal of this sinful relation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never willingly separate myself from my dear prince and master&mdash;from
      the father of my two children. Your majesty will be obliged to force me
      from him,&rdquo; answered Wilhelmine, defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that will not be necessary, mademoiselle,&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;There are
      ways enough. I will make known my wishes to the prince; I will command him
      to leave you, and have no further communication with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; she answered, gently, &ldquo;I know that the prince is an obedient and
      respectful subject and servant to his king in all things, but this command
      he would not obey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not dare to brave my commands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would not brave them, sire. Oh, no; it would be simply impossible to
      obey them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would hinder him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love, sire; the respect which he owes to me as the mother of his two
      children&mdash;who has consecrated her love, her honor to him, and of whom
      no one can say that she has injured the fidelity which she has sworn to
      the prince&mdash;to the man of her first and only love&mdash;even with a
      word or look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say, that I cannot separate you from the prince but by
      force?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your majesty,&rdquo; cried she, with conscious power, &ldquo;that is exactly
      what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will find yourself deceived; you will be made to realize it,&rdquo; said
      the king, with a menacing tone. &ldquo;You know nothing of the power that lies
      in a legitimate marriage, and what rivals legitimate children are, whom
      one dares acknowledge before God&mdash;before the world. Boast not of the
      love of the prince, but remember that an honorable solitude is the only
      situation becoming to you. Such connections bear their own curse and
      punishment with them. Hasten to avoid them. Lastly, I would add, never
      dare to mingle your impure hands in the affairs of state. I have been
      obliged to give the order to the state councillors in appointments and
      grants of office, not to regard the protection and recommendation of a
      certain high personage, as you are the real protectress and bestower of
      mercy. Take care, and never let it happen again. You will never venture to
      play the little Pompadour here, nor anything else but what your dishonor
      allows you; otherwise you will have to deal with me! You say that you have
      read Homer; then, doubtless, you remember the story of Penelope, who, from
      conjugal fidelity, spun and wove, undoing at night what she had woven by
      day. It is true, you bear little resemblance to this chaste dame, but you
      might emulate her in spinning and weaving; and if you are not in future
      retiring, I can easily make a modern Penelope of you, and have you
      instructed in spinning, for which you will have the best of opportunities
      in the house of correction at Spandau. Remember this, and never permit
      yourself to practise protection. I will keep the spinning-wheel and the
      wool ready for you; that you may count upon. Remember, also, that it is
      very disagreeable to me that you visit my park, as I like to breathe pure
      air. Direct your promenade elsewhere, and avoid meeting me in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence! I have heard sufficient. You have nothing more to say to me. Go,
      hide your head, that no one may recognize your shame, or the levity of the
      prince. Go&mdash;and, farewell forever!&rdquo; He motioned impatiently to her to
      retire, fastening his eyes with a fiery, penetrating glance upon her pale,
      agitated face, her bowed, humble attitude, and still continued to regard
      her as she painfully dragged herself down the walk, as if her limbs were
      giving way under her. Long stood the king gazing after her, resting upon
      his staff; and as she disappeared at the end of the walk, he still stood
      there immovable. By degrees his face assumed a milder expression. &ldquo;He who
      is free from sin, let him cast the first stone at her,&rdquo; said the king,
      softened, as he slowly turned down the path which would lead to his
      carriage, waiting outside the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederick was lost in thought, and addressed no conversation to the
      equerry, Von Schwerin, who sat opposite to him. But as they drove through
      the beautiful street Unten den Linden, at Berlin, Frederick glanced at the
      equerry, and found that he had fallen asleep, wearied with the long
      silence and the monotony of the drive. The king spoke to Alkmene, loud and
      earnestly, until Herr von Schwerin, awakened and startled, glanced at the
      king, frightened, and trying to discover whether his fearful crime against
      etiquette would draw upon him the royal censure. Frederick, however,
      appeared not to notice his fright, and spoke kindly to him: &ldquo;Did you not
      tell me, Schwerin, that Count Schmettau would sell his country residence
      at Charlottenburg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service, your majesty, he asked me to purchase it, or find him a
      purchaser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much is it worth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, Count Schmettau demands eight thousand dollars for it. There is a
      beautiful park belonging to it, and the house is worthy the name of a
      castle, so large is it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not buy it, if the count offered it to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The equerry assumed a sad mien, and answered, sighing: &ldquo;Sire, I should be
      the happiest of men if I could buy that charming residence, and it would
      be a real blessing to me if I could enjoy in summer at times the fresh
      air. My finances unfortunately, do not allow such expenses, as I am not
      rich, and have a large family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are right not to spend money unnecessarily,&rdquo; said the king,
      quietly. &ldquo;You can have as much fresh air at Potsdam as can ever enter your
      mouth, and it costs neither you nor I any thing. Say to Count Schmettau
      that you have a purchaser for his residence at Charlottenburg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are really too kind,&rdquo; cried the equerry, in an excitement of joy;
      &ldquo;I do not know&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the carriage entered the palace court, and the concluding words were
      inaudible. Herr von Schwerin alighted quickly to assist the king. &ldquo;Say to
      Schmettau to present himself to my treasurer and cabinet councillor,
      Menkon, tomorrow morning at twelve o&rsquo;clock, at Sans-Souci.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king nodded kindly to the equerry, and passed into the Swiss saloon,
      and farther on into the private rooms which he was accustomed to occupy
      whenever he remained at the capital. The Swiss saloon was fast filling,
      not alone with the generals and staff-officers of the Berlin garrison, but
      with the officers of the regiments from the provinces, who presented
      themselves at the palace according to the order of the king. The most of
      them were old and worn out, body and mind. They all looked morose and
      sorrowful. The great news of the approaching war with Austria had spread
      through the military. The old laurel-crowned generals of the Seven Years&rsquo; 
      War were unwilling to go forth to earn new laurels, for which they had
      lost all ambition. Not one dared betray his secret thoughts to another, or
      utter a word of disapproval. The king&rsquo;s spies were everywhere, and none
      could trust himself to converse with his neighbor, as he might prove to be
      one of them. There reigned an anxious, oppressive silence; the generals
      and staff-officers exchanged the ordinary greetings. All eyes were turned
      toward the door through which the king would enter, bowed down, like his
      generals, with the cares of life, and the burden of old age. The king
      slowly entered. He was, indeed, an old man, like those he came amongst,
      and now saluted. An expression of imperishable youth lighted up his pale,
      sunken face, and his eyes flashed with as much daring and fire as
      thirty-eight years before, when he had assembled his young officers around
      him in this very hall, to announce to them that he would march against
      Austria. How many wars, how many battles, how many illusions, victories,
      and defeats had the king experienced in these thirty-eight years! How
      little the youthful, fiery king of that day resembled the weak old man of
      to-day; how little in common the young King Frederick had with &ldquo;Alten
      Fritz.&rdquo; And now in this feeble body dwelt the same courageous spirit. In
      the course of these years King Frederick II had become Frederick the
      Great! And great he was to-day, this little old man&mdash;great in his
      intentions and achievements, never heeding his own debility and need of
      repose. All his thoughts and endeavors concentrated on the welfare of his
      people and his country&mdash;on the greatness and glory of Germany. Those
      eyes which now glanced over the circle of generals were still flashing as
      those of the hero-king whose look had disarmed the lurking assassin, and
      confounded the distinguished savant in the midst of his eloquence, so that
      he stammered and was silent. He was still Frederick the Great, who,
      leaning upon his staff, was surrounded by his generals, whom he called to
      fight for their fatherland, for Germany!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I have called you together to announce to you
      that we must go forth to new wars, and, God willing, to new victories. The
      Emperor of Austria forces me to it, for, against all laws and customs, and
      against all rights of kingdoms, he thinks to bring German territory into
      the possession of the house of Hapsburg. Charles Theodore, prince-elector,
      having no children, has concluded a treaty with the Emperor Joseph, that
      at his death the electorate of Bavaria will fall to Austria. In
      consequence thereof an Austrian army has marched into Bavaria, and
      garrisoned the frontier.&mdash;The prince-elector, Duke Charles Theodore,
      was not authorized to proceed thus, for, though he had no children to
      succeed him, he had a lawful successor in his brother&rsquo;s son, Duke Charles
      von Zweibrucken. Electoral Saxony and Mecklenburg have well-founded
      pretensions, even if Zweibrucken were not existing. All these princes have
      addressed themselves to me, and requested me to represent them to the
      emperor and to the imperial government&mdash;to protect them in their
      injured rights. I have first tried kindness and persuasion to bring back
      Austria from her desire of aggrandizement, but in Vienna they have
      repulsed every means of peaceable arbitration. I, as one of the rulers of
      the empire (and as I have reaffirmed the Westphalian treaty through the
      Hubertsburger treaty), feel bound to preserve the privileges, the rights,
      the liberty of the German states. I have therefore well reflected, and
      decided to draw the sword&mdash;that what the diplomats have failed to
      arrange with the pen should be settled with the sword. These are my
      reasons, gentlemen, which make it my duty to assemble an army; therefore I
      have called you together.&rdquo; His fiery eyes flashed around the circle,
      peeling into the thin, withered faces of his generals, and encountering
      everywhere a grave, earnest mien.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king repressed with an effort a sigh; then continued, with a mild
      voice: &ldquo;My feeble old age does not allow me to travel as in my fiery
      youth. I shall use a post-carriage, and you, gentlemen, have the liberty
      to do the same. On the day of battle you will find me mounted; you will
      follow my example. Until then, farewell!&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: The king&rsquo;s words.&mdash;See
      &ldquo;Prussia, Frederick the Great,&rdquo; vol. iii.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo; cried General von Krokow; and all the generals who
      formerly joined in this cry of the Prussian warrior, now repeated it in
      weak, trembling tones. Frederick smiled a recognition, bowing on all
      sides, then turned slowly away, leaning upon his staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      When once more alone, the youthful expression faded from his eyes, and the
      gloomy shadows of old age settled down upon his thoughtful brow. &ldquo;They
      have all grown old and morose,&rdquo; said he, mildly, &ldquo;they will not show any
      more heroism; the fire of ambition is quenched in their souls! A warm
      stove must warm their old limbs. Oh! it is a pitiful thing to grow old;
      and still they call themselves the images of God! Poor boasters, who, with
      a breath of the Almighty, are overturned and bent as a blade of grass in
      the sand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, may I come in?&rdquo; asked a gentle, happy child&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king turned hastily toward the door, so softly opened, and there stood
      a charming little boy, in the uniform of a flag-bearer, with the cap upon
      his head, and a neat little sword by his side. &ldquo;Yes, you may enter,&rdquo;
       nodded the king kindly to him. &ldquo;You know I sent for you, my little
      flag-bearer.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER III. FREDERICK WILLIAM.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The little flag-bearer skipped into the room with graceful vivacity, and
      sprang, with a merry bound, up to the king, took his hand without
      ceremony, and pressed it to his lips. Then, raising up his head and
      shaking back his light-brown curls from his rosy cheeks, his bright-blue
      eyes sparkling, he looked him full in the face. &ldquo;Your majesty, you say
      that you sent for me; but I must tell you that if you had not sent for me
      I would have come here alone, and begged so long at the door, that you
      would have let me come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if I would not have let you come in at all?&rdquo; said the king,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little flag-bearer reflected a moment, then answered with a confident
      air: &ldquo;Your majesty, I would have forced open the door, thrown myself at
      your feet, and kissed your hand, saying, &lsquo;My king, my dear great-uncle, I
      must come in to thank you a thousand times for the flag-bearer&rsquo;s
      commission you have sent me, and for the beautiful uniform.&rsquo; Then I would
      see if your majesty had the courage to send me away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see, my prince&mdash;do you think my courage could fail me upon
      any occasion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in bad things,&rdquo; zealously cried the prince, &ldquo;and it would be bad if
      you would not let me thank you. I am so happy with the commission and the
      beautiful uniform which you so graciously sent to me! Tell me, your
      majesty, do I not look beautifully?&rdquo; The boy straightened his elegant,
      slender form, and saluted the king, putting the two fingers of his right
      hand upon his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Frederick, &ldquo;you look very nicely, my prince; but it is
      not enough that you look well&mdash;you must behave well. From a
      flag-bearer in my army I expect very different things than from any common
      child. Who wears my uniform must prove himself worthy of the honor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; cried the prince, &ldquo;I assure you, upon my word of honor,
      that I have no bad marks when I wear the uniform. Your majesty can ask my
      tutor. He came with me, and waits in the anteroom to speak with you. He
      will tell you that I have a good report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, we will call him presently,&rdquo; said Frederick, smiling. &ldquo;Now we
      will chat a little together. Tell me whether you are very industrious, and
      if you are learning anything of consequence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I must learn, even if I had no inclination to; Herr Behnisch leaves
      me no peace. I have scarcely time to play. I am always learning to read,
      to write, to cipher, and to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the geography and universal history?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your majesty, I wish there were no geography and history in the
      world, and then I should not have to study so cruelly hard, and I could
      play more. My mother sent me last week a new battledore and shuttlecock,
      but I can never learn to play with it. I no sooner begin, than Herr
      Behnisch calls me to study. To-day I was very cunning&mdash;oh, I was so
      sly! I put it in the great-pocket of my tutor&rsquo;s coat, and he brought it
      here without knowing it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was very naughty,&rdquo; said the king, a little severely. The prince
      colored, and, a little frightened, said: &ldquo;Sire, I could not bring it any
      other way. I beg pardon, the uniform is so tight, and then&mdash;then, I
      thought it would be dishonoring it to put a shuttlecock in the
      cartridge-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a good thought, prince, and for that I will forgive you the
      trick upon your tutor. But what will you do with the ball here? Why did
      you bring it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wished to show it to your majesty, it is so beautiful, and then beg
      you to let me play a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see, Fritz,&rdquo; said the king, much pleased. &ldquo;If you deserve it,
      that shall be your reward. Tell me the truth, is your tutor satisfied with
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, Herr Behnisch is never really pleased, but he has not scolded me
      much lately, so I must have been pretty good. One day he wrote &lsquo;Bien&rsquo; 
      under my French exercise. Oh, I was so happy that I spent six groschen of
      the thaler my father gave me a little while since, and bought two pots of
      gilly-flowers, one for myself and one for my little brother Henry, that he
      should have a souvenir of my &lsquo;Bien!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was right,&rdquo; said the king, nodding approvingly. &ldquo;When you are good,
      you must always let your friends and relations take part in it; keep the
      bad only for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will remember that, and I thank you for the kind instruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The studies seem to go very well, but how is it with the behavior? They
      tell me that the prince is not always polite to his visitors; that he is
      sometimes very rude, even to the officers who pay their respects to him on
      his father&rsquo;s account, and on my account, not on his own, for what do they
      care for such a little snip as he? They go to honor Prince Frederick
      William of Prussia, though he is only a little flag-bearer. They tell me
      that you do not appreciate the honor, but that at Easter you behaved very
      badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it is true; I cannot deny it&mdash;I did behave badly,&rdquo; sighed the
      little prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the matter?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;It was not from fear, I hope? I
      should be very angry at that. Tell me yourself, and tell me the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty can depend upon the whole truth. My tutor says that lying is
      despicable, and that a prince who will one day be a king should be too
      proud to tell a lie! I will tell you all about it. The officers came to
      see me at Easter, just as I had put the Easter eggs in the garden, for my
      little brother and some other boys whom I had invited to hunt for them. I
      had spent my last six groschen for the eggs, and I anticipated so much
      pleasure with the hide-and-seek for them. We had just begun, when the
      officers came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was really unfortunate,&rdquo; said the king, sympathizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, very disagreeable, and I could not possibly feel kindly. While
      the officers were talking, I was always wishing they would go. But they
      stayed and stayed&mdash;and when Major von Werder began to make a long
      speech to me, and I thought there was no end to it, I became impatient and
      furious&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you hesitate?&rdquo; asked the king, looking tenderly at the frank,
      glowing face of the boy. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something dreadful, sire! I could not keep in any longer. The major kept
      on talking, and looked at me so sharply, I could not help making an
      abominable face. It is unfortunately true&mdash;I ran my tongue out at him&mdash;only
      just a little bit&mdash;and I drew it back in an instant; but it was done,
      and a dreadful scene followed. The major did not say any thing, my tutor
      was red as fire, and I was thunderstruck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was excessively rude, my little flag-bearer,&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young prince was so ashamed, and was looking down so penitently, that
      he did not see the smile on Frederick&rsquo;s face, and the affectionate look
      with which he regarded the youthful sinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that you deserve to be imprisoned fourteen days, and live on
      bread and water, for insubordination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it now, sire. I beg pardon most humbly,&rdquo; said the prince, with
      quivering voice and with tears in his eyes. &ldquo;I have been punished enough,
      without that. Herr Behnisch would not let me go to the garden again, and I
      have never seen the eggs which I spent my last groschen for, nor the boys
      whom I had invited. I was made to stay in my room all Easter week, learn
      twenty Latin words every day, and write three pages of German words in
      good handwriting. It was a hard punishment, but I knew that I deserved it,
      and did not complain. I only thought that I would do better in future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you thought so, and you have already been punished, we will say no
      more about it,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;But tell me, how did you get on at
      Whitsuntide, when the officers paid you their respects again?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; answered the prince, &ldquo;it was a great deal better; I
      behaved tolerably well, except a very little rudeness, which was not so
      bad after all. <i>[Footnote: The little prince&rsquo;s own words.&mdash;See
      &ldquo;Diary of Prince Frederick William,&rdquo; p. 18.]</i> Herr Behnisch did not
      punish me; he only said, another time, that I should do better, and not be
      so taciturn, but greet the gentlemen in a more friendly manner. I must
      tell you, sire, that when Herr Behnisch does not scold, it is a sure sign
      that I have behaved pretty well; and this time he did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fritz, I believe you,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and you shall have the reward that
      you asked for&mdash;stay here and play a little while. Go, now, and call
      your tutor; I have a few words to say to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little prince sprang toward the door, but suddenly stopped,
      embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;Why do you not call your tutor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I am very much troubled. Herr Behnisch will be very angry when you
      tell him about the shuttlecock. I beg you not to betray me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but if you will play before me, you must get the plaything which you
      say is in his pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, then I had rather not play,&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;your punishment shall be, to take the
      plaything as cleverly out of the pocket as you put it in. If you do it
      well, then I will say nothing about it; but, if your tutor discovers you,
      then you must submit to the storm. It lies in your own hands. Whilst I am
      conversing with the tutor, try your luck. Now call him in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince obeyed thoughtfully, and the tutor entered. He stood near the
      door, and made the three prescribed bows; then he waited with a submissive
      air for further commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was sitting opposite the door, his hands folded upon his staff
      and his chin resting upon his hands, looking the tutor full in the face.
      Herr Behnisch bore it calmly; not a feature moved in his angular, wooden
      face. Near the tutor stood the little prince, his graceful, rosy,
      childlike face expressing eager expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Approach!&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Behnisch stepped forward a little, and remained standing. The prince
      glided noiselessly after him, keeping his eyes fixed on the tails of the
      flesh-colored satin coat with which the tutor had adorned himself for this
      extraordinary occasion. The prince smiled as he saw the pocket open and
      the feathers of the shuttlecock peeping out. He stretched out his little
      hand and crooked his fingers to seize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come nearer! Herr Behnisch,&rdquo; said Frederick, who had observed the
      movement of the little prince, and who was amused at the thought of
      keeping him in suspense a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Behnisch moved forward, and the prince, frightened, remained standing
      with outstretched hand. He menaced the king with a glance of his bright
      blue eyes. Frederick caught the look, smiled, and turned to the tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is three years since you commenced teaching the little
      prince?&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service, your majesty, since 1775.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tolerably long time,&rdquo; said the king&mdash;&ldquo;long enough to make a savant
      of a child of Nature. You have been faithful, and I am satisfied. The
      copybooks which you sent me according to my orders are satisfactory. I
      wished to acquaint you myself of my satisfaction, therefore I sent for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty is very condescending,&rdquo; said the tutor, and his sharp,
      angular face brightened a little. &ldquo;I am very happy in the gracious
      satisfaction of your royal highness. I wished also to make known to you
      personally my wishes in regard to the petition for the little prince&rsquo;s
      pocket-money; he should learn the use of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the king, nodding to the prince, who stood behind the
      tutor, holding up triumphantly the shuttle cock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, the most difficult feat remained to be accomplished. The battledoor
      was in the very depths of the pocket; only the point of the handle was
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; cried Herr Behnisch, who had taken the approving
      exclamation of &ldquo;very well&rdquo; to himself&mdash;&ldquo;your majesty, I am very happy
      that you have the grace to approve of my petition for pocket-money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think it well,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;that the prince should learn not
      to throw money out of the window. I will send you, monthly, for the
      prince, two Fredericks d&rsquo;or, and, before you hand it over to him, change
      it into small pieces, that there may be a great pile of it.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote:
      The king&rsquo;s own words&mdash;See &ldquo;Confidential Letters.&rdquo;]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment the prince tried to seize the battle door. Herr
      Behnisch felt the movement, and was on the point of turning around, when
      Frederick stopped him, by saying, &ldquo;I believe it is time to commence a
      regular course of instruction for the prince. At eight years of age the
      education of an heir to the throne must progress rapidly, and be regulated
      by fixed principles. I will write out my instructions, that you may always
      have them before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be my most earnest endeavor to follow your majesty&rsquo;s commands to
      the letter,&rdquo; answered the tutor, who saw not the little prince, with
      beaming face, behind him, swinging the battledoor high in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am about to enter upon a new war; no one knows if he will ever return
      from a campaign. I dare not spare my life, when the honor and fame of my
      house are at stake. Our life and death, however, are in God&rsquo;s hands.
      Before we risk our lives, we should put every thing in order, and leave
      nothing undone which it is our duty to do. I will write my instructions
      to-day, and send them to you. Promise me, upon your word of honor as a
      man, that you will act upon them, as long as you are tutor to Prince
      Frederick William, even if I should not return from the campaign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promise it to your majesty,&rdquo; answered the tutor. &ldquo;I will, in all
      things, according to the best of my ability, follow your majesty&rsquo;s
      instructions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you; I take you to be an honorable man,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;You
      will always be mindful of the great responsibility which rests upon you,
      as you have a prince to educate who will one day govern a kingdom, and
      upon whom the weal and woe of many millions are dependent. And when those
      millions of men one day bless the king whom you have educated, a part of
      the blessing will fall upon you; but when they curse him, so falls the
      curse likewise upon your guilty head, and you will feel the weight of it,
      though you may be in your grave! Be mindful of this, and act accordingly.
      Now you may depart. I will write the instructions immediately, so that you
      may receive them to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr Behnisch bowed, backing out toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing more,&rdquo; cried the king, motioning with his Staff to the tutor.
      &ldquo;In order that you may ever remember our interview, I will present you
      with a souvenir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the drawer of his private writing-table, and took out a gold
      snuff-box, with his initials set in brilliants upon the cover; handing it
      to Herr Behnisch, he motioned him to retire, and thus spare him the
      expression of his gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; stammered Herr Behnisch, with tears in his eyes, &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an honest man, and so long as you remain so, you can count upon
      me. Adieu!&mdash;Now,&rdquo; said the king, as the door closed, &ldquo;have you
      recovered the plaything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is, your majesty,&rdquo; shouted the prince, as he held up triumphantly
      the battledoor and shuttlecock high in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You deserve your reward, and you shall have it. You can stay with me and
      play with it here. Take care and not make too much noise, as I wish to
      write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king now seated himself, to draw up the instructions for Herr
      Behnisch. While he was thus occupied, the little prince tossed his
      shuttlecock, springing lightly after it on tiptoe to catch it; sometimes
      he missed it, and then he cast an imploring look at the king, as it fell
      upon the furniture; but he observed it not. He was absorbed in writing the
      instructions for the education of the future king, Frederick William III.
      The physical education of the prince was his first care. He dwelt upon the
      necessity of the frequent practice of dancing, fencing, and riding, to
      give suppleness, grace, and a good carriage&mdash;through severe training,
      to make him capable of enduring all hardships. The different branches of
      study next occupied the king. &ldquo;It is not sufficient,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;that the
      prince should learn the dates of history, to repeat them like a parrot;
      but he must understand how to compare the events of ancient times with the
      modern, and discover the causes which produced revolutions, and show that,
      generally, in the world, virtue is rewarded and vice punished. Later, he
      can learn a short course of logic, free from all pedantry; then study the
      orations of Cicero and Demosthenes, and read the tragedies of Racine. When
      older, he should have some knowledge of the opinions of philosophers, and
      the different religious sects, without inspiring him with dislike for any
      one sect. Make it clear to him that we all worship God&mdash;only in
      different ways. It is not necessary that he should have too much respect
      for the priests who instruct him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shuttlecock fell, at this instant, upon the paper upon which the king
      was writing. Frederick was too much occupied to look up, but he threw it
      upon the floor, continuing to write:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great object will be to awaken a love of learning in the prince, to
      prevent any approach to pedantry, and not to make the course of
      instruction too severe at the commencement. We now come to the chief
      division of education, that which concerns the morals. Neither you nor all
      the power in the world would be sufficient to alter the character of a
      child. Education can do nothing further than moderate the violence of the
      passions. Treat my nephew as the son of a citizen, who has to make his own
      fortune. Say to him that, when he commits follies, and learns nothing, the
      whole world will despise him. Let him assume no mannerisms, but bring him
      up simply. The&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the second time the shuttlecock fell upon the paper. The king
      looked up censuringly at the prince, who stood speechless with fright and
      anxiety. The king again threw it upon the floor, and wrote on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prince must be polite toward every one; and if he is rude, he must
      immediately make an apology. Teach him that all men are equal&mdash;that
      high birth is a myth when not accompanied with merit. Let the prince speak
      with every one, that he may gain confidence. It is of no consequence if he
      talks nonsense; every one knows that he is a child. Take care in his
      education, above all things, that he is self-reliant, and not led by
      others; his follies, as well as his good qualities, should belong to
      himself. It is of very great importance to inspire him with a love for
      military life; and for this reason say to him, and let him hear others say
      it, that every man who is not a soldier is a miserable fellow, whether
      noble or not. He must see the soldiers exercise as often as possible; and
      it would be well to send for five or six cadets, and have them drill
      before him. Every thing depends upon cultivating a taste for these things.
      Inspire him with a love of our country, above all things. Let no one speak
      to him who is not truly patriotic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the shuttlecock fell upon the paper. The little prince uttered a cry
      of horror, staring at the plaything. This time the king did not receive
      the interruption so calmly. He looked at the speechless boy as if very
      angry; then took it and put it in his pocket. Casting another angry glance
      at the prince, he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The officers who dine with the prince shall tease and annoy him, that he
      may become confident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; said the prince, timidly and imploringly, &ldquo;I beg pardon a
      thousand times for being so awkward. I am sorry, and I will be more
      careful in the future.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king paid no attention to him, but continued to write: &ldquo;When you
      understand him better, try to learn his chief passion to uproot it, but to
      moderate it.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: This entire instruction is an exact
      translation of the original, which Frederick drew up in French, and which
      is included in his &ldquo;Complete Works.&rdquo;]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lord and king,&rdquo; began the prince again, &ldquo;I beg you will have the
      goodness to give me my shuttlecock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king was silent, and with apparent indifference commenced reading over
      what he had written.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prince Frederick William waited a long time, but, on receiving no answer,
      and understanding that his pleading was in vain, his face grew red with
      anger, and his eyes flashed. With an irritated, determined manner, he
      stepped close up to the king, his hands resting upon his hips. &ldquo;Your
      majesty,&rdquo; cried he, with a menacing tone, &ldquo;will you give me my ball or
      not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king now looked up at the prince, who regarded him in an insolent,
      questioning manner. A smile, mild as the evening sunset, spread over the
      king&rsquo;s face; he laid his hand lovingly upon the curly head of the prince,
      saying: &ldquo;They will never take away Silesia from you. Here is your
      shuttlecock.&rdquo; He drew it from his pocket, and gave it to the little
      prince, who seized his hand and pressed it to his lips.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV. THE DRIVE TO BERLIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine Enke passed the remainder of the day, after her meeting with
      the king, in anguish and tears. She recalled all that he had said to her,
      every word of which pierced her to the heart. Her little daughter of seven
      years tried in vain to win a smile from her mamma with her gentle
      caresses. In vain she begged her to sing to her and smile as she was wont
      to do. The mother, usually so kind and affectionate, would today free
      herself from her child, and sent her away with quivering lip, and tears in
      her eyes, to listen to her nurse&rsquo;s stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once alone, Wilhelmine paced her room with rapid strides and folded arms,
      giving vent to her repressed anguish. She reviewed her life, with all its
      changing scenes. It was a sad, searching retrospection, but in it she
      found consolation and excuse for herself. She thought of her childhood;
      she saw the gloomy dwelling where she had lived with her parents,
      brothers, and sisters. She recalled the need and the want of those years&mdash;the
      sickly, complaining, but busy mother; the foolish, wicked father, who
      never ceased his constant exercise of the bugle, except to take repeated
      draughts of brandy, or scold the children. Then she saw in this joyless
      dwelling, in which she crouched with her little sisters, a young girl
      enter, and greet them smilingly. She wore a robe glittering with gold,
      with transparent wings upon her shoulders. This young girl was
      Wilhelmine&rsquo;s older sister, Sophie, who had just returned from the Italian
      opera, where she was employed. She still had on her fairy costume in which
      she had danced in the opera of &ldquo;Armida,&rdquo; and had come, with a joyous face,
      to take leave of her parents, and tell them that a rich Russian count
      loved her, and wanted to marry her; that in the intervening time he had
      taken a beautiful apartment for her, where she would remove that very
      evening. She must bid them farewell, for her future husband was waiting
      for her in the carriage at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sophie laughed at her grumbling father, shook hands with her weeping
      mother, and bent to kiss the children. Wilhelmine, in unspeakable anguish,
      sprang after her, holding her fast, with both hands clinching the
      crackling wings. She implored her sister to take her with her, while the
      tears ran in streams down her cheeks. &ldquo;You know that I love you,&rdquo; she
      cried, &ldquo;and my only pleasure is to see you every day. Take me with you,
      and I will serve and obey you, and be your waiting-maid.&rdquo; Wilhelmine held
      the wings firmly with a convulsive grasp, and continued to weep and
      implore, until Sophie at last laughingly yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come, if you will be my waiting-maid; no one combs hair as well as
      you, and your simple style of arranging it suits me better than any other.
      Come, come, it shall be arranged, you shall be my waiting-maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The pictures of memory changed, and Wilhelmine saw herself in the midst of
      splendor, as the poor little maid, unnoticed by her brilliant sister, the
      beloved of the Russian Count Matuschko. Joy and pleasure reigned in the
      beautifully gilded apartment where Sophie lived. She was the queen of the
      feasts and the balls. Many rich and fine gentlemen came there, and the
      beautiful Sophie, the dancer, the affianced of Count Matuschko, received
      their homage. No one observed the sad little waiting-maid, in her dark
      stuff dress, with her face bound up in black silk, as if she had the
      toothache. She wore the cast-off morning dresses of her sister, and, at
      her command, bound her face with the black silk, so that the admirers of
      her sister should not see, by a fugitive glance, or chance meeting, the
      budding beauty of the little maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine dared not enter the saloon when visitors were there; only when
      Sophie was alone, or her artistic hand was needed to arrange her sister&rsquo;s
      beautiful hair, was she permitted to stay with the future countess. Every
      rough touch was resented with harsh words, blows, and ill-treatment. The
      smiling fairy of the drawing-room, was the harsh, grim mistress for her
      sister, whose every mistake was punished with unrelenting severity. In
      fact, she was made a very slave; and now, after long years, the
      remembrance of it even cast a gloomy shadow over Wilhelmine&rsquo;s face, and
      her eyes flashed fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another picture now rose up before her soul, which caused her face to
      brighten, as a beautiful beaming image presented itself, the image of her
      first and only love! She lived over again the day when it rose up like a
      sun before her wondering, admiring gaze, and yet it was a stormy day for
      her. Sophie was very angry with her, because in crimping her hair she had
      burnt her cheek, which turned the fairy into a fury. She threw the weak
      child upon the floor, and beat and stamped upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a loud, angry voice commanded her to cease, and a strong, manly
      arm raised the trembling, weeping girl, and with threatening tone bade
      Sophie be quiet. Prince Frederick William of Prussia took compassion on
      the poor child. The sister had not remarked him in her paroxysm of rage;
      had never heard him enter. He had been a witness to Wilhelmine&rsquo;s
      ill-treatment. He now defended her, blaming her sister for her cruelty to
      her, and declared his intention to be her future protector. How handsome
      he looked; how noble in his anger; how his eyes flashed as he gazed upon
      her, who knelt at his feet, and kissed them, looking up to him as her
      rescuer!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilhelmine, come with me; I do not wish you to remain here,&rdquo; said he;
      &ldquo;your sister will never forgive you that I have taken your part. Come, I
      will take you to your parents, and provide for you. You shall be as
      beautiful and accomplished a lady as your sister, but, Heaven grant, a
      more generous and noble-hearted one! Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words, spoken with a gentle, winning voice, had never died away in
      her heart. Twelve years had passed since then, and they still rang in her
      ear, in the tumult of the world as well as in the quiet of her lonely
      room. They had comforted her when the shame of her existence oppressed
      her; rejoiced her when, with the delight of youth and happiness, she had
      given herself up to pleasure. She had followed him quietly, devotedly, as
      a little dog follows his master. He had kept his word; he had had her
      instructed during three years, and then sent her to Paris, in order to
      give her the last polish, the tournure of the world, however much it had
      cost him to separate from her, or might embarrass him, with his scanty
      means, to afford the increase of expense. A year elapsed and Wilhelmine
      returned a pleasing lady, familiar with the tone of the great world, and
      at home in its manners and customs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince had kept his word&mdash;that which he had promised her as he
      took her from her sister&rsquo;s house, to make her a fine, accomplished lady.
      And when he repeated to her now &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; could she refuse him&mdash;him to
      whom she owed every thing, whom she loved as her benefactor, her teacher,
      her friend, and lover? She followed him, and concealed herself for him in
      the modest little dwelling at Potsdam. For him she lived in solitude,
      anxiously avoiding to show herself publicly, that the king should never
      know of her existence, and in his just anger sever the unlawful tie which
      bound her to the Prince of Prussia. <i>[Footnote: &ldquo;Memoirs of the Countess
      Lichtenau,&rdquo; p. 80.]</i> Wilhelmine recalled the past seven years of her
      life, her two children, whom she had borne to the prince, and the joy that
      filled his heart as he became a father, although his lawful wife had also
      borne him children. She looked around her small, quiet dwelling, arranged
      in a modest manner, not as the favorite of the Prince of Prussia, but as
      an unpretending citizen&rsquo;s wife; she thought how oft with privations, with
      want even, she had had to combat; how oft the ornaments which the prince
      had sent her in the rare days of abundance had been taken to the
      pawnbrokers to provide the necessary wants of herself and children. Her
      eyes flashed with pride and joy at the thought which she dared to breathe
      to herself, that not for gold or riches, power or position, had she sold
      her love, her honor, and her good name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was from pure affinity, from gratitude and affection, that I followed
      the husband of my heart, although he was a prince,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the shame of her existence weighed upon her. The king had commanded
      her to hide her head so securely that no one might know her shame, or the
      levity of the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go! and let me never see you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did not this mean that the king would remove her so far that there would
      not be a possible chance to appear again before him? Was there not hidden
      in these words a menace, a warning? Would not the king revenge on her the
      sad experiences of his youth? Perhaps he would punish her for what Doris
      Ritter had suffered! Doris Ritter! She, too, had loved a crown prince&mdash;she,
      too, had dared to raise her eyes to the future King of Prussia, for which
      she was cruelly punished, though chaste and pure, and hurled down to the
      abyss of shame for the crime of loving an heir to the throne. Beaten,
      insulted, and whipped through the streets, and then sent to the house of
      correction at Spandau! Oh, poor, unhappy Doris Ritter! Will the king atone
      to you&mdash;will he revenge the friend of his youth on the mistress of
      his successor? The old King Frederick, weary of life, thinks differently
      from the young crown prince. He can be as severe as his father, cruel and
      inexorable as he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doris Ritter! Thy fate haunts me. On the morrow I also may be whipped
      through the streets, scorned, reviled by the rabble, and then sent to
      Spandau as a criminal. Did not the king threaten me with the house of
      correction, with the spinning-wheel, which he would have ready for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the thought of it a terrible anguish, a nameless despair, seized her.
      She felt that the spinning-wheel hung over her like the sword of Damocles,
      ready at the least occasion to fall upon her, and bind her to it. She felt
      that she could not endure such suspense and torture; she must escape; she
      must rescue herself from the king&rsquo;s anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whither, whither! I must fly from here, from his immediate proximity,
      where a motion of his finger is sufficient to seize me, to cause me to
      disappear before the prince could have any knowledge of it, before he
      could know of the danger which threatened me. I must away from Potsdam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince had arranged a little apartment in Berlin for the winter
      months, which she exchanged for Potsdam in the spring. This seemed to
      offer her more security for the moment, for she could fly at the least
      sign of danger, could even hide herself from the prince, if it were
      necessary to save him and herself. Away to Berlin, then! That was the only
      thought she was able to seize upon. Away with her children, before
      misfortune could reach them!
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang to the door, tore it open, rushing to the nurse, upon whose
      knees the baby slept, near whom her little daughter knelt. With trembling
      hands she took her boy and pressed him to her heart. &ldquo;Louisa, we must
      leave here immediately; it is urgent necessity!&rdquo; said she, with quivering
      lip. &ldquo;Do not say a word about it to any one, but hasten; order quickly a
      wagon, bargain for the places, and say we must set off at once. The wagon
      must not be driven to the door, but we will meet it at the Berlin Gate. We
      will go on foot there, and get in. Quick, Louisa, not a word&mdash;it must
      be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant did not dare to oppose her mistress, or contradict the orders,
      but hastened to obey them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all the old king&rsquo;s fault,&rdquo; said Louisa to herself, as she hurried
      through the street. &ldquo;Yes, the king has ordered mistress to Berlin. He
      looked so furious, the old bear! His eyes flashed so terribly, one might
      well fear him, and I thanked Heaven when mamselle sent me home from the
      park. It is coming to a bad end at last; I should have done better not to
      have taken the place at all. Oh, if we were only away from here; if I only
      could find a wagon to take us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thanks to the nurse&rsquo;s fears and endeavors, the wagon was soon found, and
      scarcely an hour had passed before Wilhelmine Enke, her two children and
      nurse, were hidden under a plain linen-covered wagon, and on their way to
      Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street was unusually animated, as the division of troops which the
      king had reviewed in Berlin, were marching out of the city to report
      themselves on the Bavarian frontier. Their first night&rsquo;s quarters were to
      be in Potsdam, and the last great parade was to take place there on the
      following morning, before the king commenced his journey. The driver had
      often to halt at the side of the street to let the troops pass, which with
      a full band of music, came marching on. At the head of one of the
      regiments, mounted upon a fiery steed, was a general in brilliant uniform,
      his breast covered with orders, which glittered in the sun. He was tall
      and rather corpulent, but appeared to advantage. His carriage was proud
      and imposing, his face was almost too youthful for a general, and his body
      too corpulent for the expressive and delicate features. As he passed by
      the poor, unpretending carriage, where Wilhelmine sat with her children,
      she heard distinctly his beautiful, sonorous voice, and merry laugh. &ldquo;Oh
      Heaven, it is he!&mdash;it is he!&rdquo; she murmured, drawing herself farther
      back into the wagon with her children. Just then, out of an opening in the
      linen cover, Louisa peeped, whispering, &ldquo;Mamselle, it is the Prince of
      Prussia!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet&mdash;for mercy&rsquo;s sake be quiet, Louisa, that we may not be
      remarked!&rdquo; said Wilhelmine, gently. &ldquo;Take the child that he may not
      scream, for if the prince should hear him he will turn back. He knows the
      voice of his little son!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he knows the voice of his little son!&rdquo; muttered the nurse, as she
      laid the child to her breast. &ldquo;The little son must stop here on the
      street, in a miserable wagon, while his noble father rides past, so
      splendid and glittering with gold, not knowing that his little boy is so
      near him. Oh, a real trouble and a real heart-sorrow is this!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; said Wilhelmine, in her heart, &ldquo;a real trouble and a real
      heart-sorrow. How all these men would present arms, and salute my
      children, if they had been born to a throne instead of obscurity! How they
      would bow and bend, if I were called Louisa of Hesse-Darmstadt, and the
      lawful wife of the prince! Did they not also bend and bow before the first
      wife, Elizabeth von Braunschweig, <i>[Footnote: The first wife of Prince
      Frederick William of Prussia was the Princess Elizabeth von Braunschweig,
      the niece of Frederick the Great. The crown prince was scarcely twenty-one
      years of age when betrothed to her. After four years they were separated,
      on account of the improper conduct of the princess, who was banished to
      Stettin. There she lived until her death in 1840, after seventy-one years
      of imprisonment. Never during these seventy-one years had the Princess
      &lsquo;Lisbeth&rsquo;, as she was called, dared to leave Stettin. There she was
      obliged to amuse herself. Her concerts and evening entertainments were
      celebrated. The second wife of the crown prince of Prussia was Louisa of
      Hesse-Darmstadt, the mother of Frederick William III. She died in 1805.]</i>
      although every one knew of her shameful conduct&mdash;knew of her
      intrigues with lackeys and common soldiers? Do they not now bow before
      her, although she is banished to Stettin for her infamous conduct, and
      lives there a prisoner? A fine imprisonment that! The whole town is her
      prison, and when she appears in public every one stands upon the street to
      salute the crown princess of Prussia. But when they see me they pass
      carelessly by, or they look at me with a contemptuous laugh, and fancy
      themselves miracles of virtue, and free from sin. My only crime is that my
      father was not a prince, and that I am of low birth. Am I to blame for
      that&mdash;to blame that the man whom I love, and who loves me, cannot
      marry me and make me his lawful wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! gee, ho!&rdquo; cried the driver to his horses. &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; The troops had
      passed, the highway was now free, and uninterrupted rolled the heavy,
      creaking wagon into Berlin. Within all was quiet. The two children and
      nurse were asleep. The driver was half asleep, his head hung shaking
      about; only now and then he started to give his horses a crack, which the
      thin, wheezing animals did not heed in the least. Wilhelmine alone slept
      not; in her soul there was no quiet, no peace. She grumbled at fate, and
      at mankind. An unspeakable anxiety seized her for the immediate future,
      and fear of the king&rsquo;s anger. As the sun was setting they reached Berlin,
      and were entering the town, when the guard, in royal livery, sprang
      through the gate, calling, in a loud voice, to the wagon, &ldquo;Halt&mdash;halt!
      Turn out of the way!&rdquo; Then was heard the call of the sentinel, and the
      roll of the drums. An equipage, drawn by six black steeds, drove past. A
      pale, young wife, splendidly attired, leaned back in the carriage, and the
      little flag-bearer, Prince Frederick William, was by her side; on the seat
      opposite sat the second son, Prince Louis, and the lord steward. In this
      beautiful equipage drove the Princess of Prussia; at her side, in a
      miserable linen-covered wagon, crouching far in the corner, sat Wilhelmine
      Enke, the rival of the princess; near her, her two children, whose
      existence condemned her, and stamped her life with dishonor. Like a dream
      the brilliant apparition rushed past Wilhelmine, and it haunted her
      through the long streets, to the humble home where she sought a temporary
      refuge. And when finally alone, in her own room, where no one could spy
      into her face, nor understand her words, there broke forth from her soul a
      long-repressed wrong. She stood erect; a proud, insolent smile played
      around her mouth. &ldquo;I am his wife, too; I alone am his beloved wife,&rdquo; said
      she, with a loud, triumphant voice, &ldquo;and my children are his only
      truly-beloved children, for they are those of his love. How proudly she
      drove past me! How beautiful is her pale face, and how interesting her sad
      smile! She in sunlight, and I in shade! She knows that I am her rival, but
      she is not mine. No, the Princess of Prussia cannot rival Wilhelmine Enke.
      I have no fear of her. But the king I have to fear,&rdquo; cried she suddenly,
      shrinking with terror. In the meeting with the princess she had forgotten
      him, her anguish, her anxiety for the future. All were forgotten for the
      moment&mdash;to be recalled with renewed terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank Heaven,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have escaped. For the moment I am safe! What
      will the prince do, when he finds that we have fled from Potsdam? Will he
      divine where we have gone? Will he come to seek me? If he still loves me&mdash;if
      I am really the happy rival of his wife and every other court lady&mdash;yes,
      then he will come. Then he will know where to find his Wilhelmine. But if
      it is true, what malicious people have repeated to me, with feigned
      sympathy, that the prince loves another&mdash;that he has withdrawn his
      love from me, is indifferent and cold&mdash;then he will not seek me; then
      I shall remain here alone!&mdash;alone, with my children, this long,
      fearful night! What, then, if I am alone? No, oh, no! I will not believe
      that I am forsaken. These are wicked thoughts which haunt me&mdash;only
      the agitation of this dreadful day, which imagination has overwrought.
      Rise up and be strong! Go to thy children,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and read in their
      eyes that he can never leave thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forcing herself to composure, she sought her children; found Louisa
      humming and singing her little boy to sleep, and her daughter nodding, on
      a low stool at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my child, I will put you to sleep,&rdquo; said the mother, lifting her in
      her arms. &ldquo;Your mother will make your bed softly. When you sleep and speak
      with the angels, intercede for us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With tender care she undressed her and bore her gently in her arms to her
      bed, and, kneeling before it, breathed a prayer over her sleeping child;
      then bent over the cradle of her son, blessing and kissing him. &ldquo;Sleep my
      boy, sleep. I know not that I shall ever see thy beautiful eyes open again&mdash;whether
      I shall ever again press thee to my heart. Who can tell if they may not
      come this very night to remove me to prison&mdash;to punish me for you, my
      children, my beloved children!&mdash;Be calm, be calm! I shall remain here
      until morning, at least,&rdquo; added she.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the nurse, who, with anxious face and folded hands, stood at
      the farthest corner of the room. &ldquo;Go, now, Louisa&mdash;go, and take
      something to eat. You must be hungry and tired. Buy at the next store what
      you need; but do not stop to talk with any one or repeat my name. Then
      return quickly, and take care of the children. Do not trouble yourself
      about me&mdash;I need nothing more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must eat something, mamselle; you must have some supper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine shook her head, refusing, and returned quickly to her own room.

      CHAPTER V. THE OATH OF FIDELITY.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Long after nightfall the nurse heard her mistress rapidly pacing her room,
      and talking aloud to herself. Soon, however, Sleep spread her soothing
      wings over Louisa, and she heard no more the rapid steps and loud talking
      of her mistress, nor the rolling of a carriage which stopped before the
      door, and the quick, vigorous steps of a man mounting the stairs. But
      Wilhelmine heard them. Breathless she stood, listening to the approaching
      footsteps, for she felt that they had to decide her future&mdash;the weal
      and woe of her children! Was it he, her beloved, the father of her
      children? or was it the king&rsquo;s bailiff who had followed her, and came to
      seize her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearer they came; the bell was hastily, violently rung. Wilhelmine uttered
      a cry of delight. She recognized the voice, the commanding manner, and
      rushed through the anteroom to open the door. The prince encircled her in
      his arms, pressed her to his beating heart, and, lifting her up, bore her
      into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you leave Potsdam, Wilhelmine? Tell me quickly, why did you do
      it?&rdquo; asked the prince, tenderly kissing her, as he sat her upon the divan
      at his side. Overcome with her tears, she could not answer. &ldquo;What mean
      these tears? Has any one dared to wound your feelings or injure you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Frederick, and he who injures me hazards nothing&mdash;for it is the
      king! I met him in the park at Potsdam this morning. He has crushed me
      with his scorn and anger. He has threatened me with a fearful punishment&mdash;no
      less than the house of correction at Spandau! He has told me that the
      spinning-wheel is in readiness for me if I excite his further contempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cry of fury escaped the prince. Springing up, he paced the room with
      rapid strides. Wilhelmine remained upon the divan, but her tears did not
      prevent her following the prince with a searching glance&mdash;to read his
      face, pale with rage. &ldquo;I must bear it,&rdquo; he cried, beating his forehead. &ldquo;I
      cannot protect those that I love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A ray of joy lighted up Wilhelmine&rsquo;s face as she listened, but it
      disappeared with the tears which flowed afresh. &ldquo;I am a poor, unfortunate
      child,&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;whom every one despises, and fears not to injure, who
      has no one to counsel or protect her, and who is lost if God does not have
      compassion upon her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince rushed to her, seizing both hands. &ldquo;Wilhelmine, do not drive me
      mad with sorrow,&rdquo; he cried, trembling with excitement and anger. &ldquo;Is it my
      fault that I cannot protect you against him? Have I not defended you from
      all the rest of the world? Have I ever allowed any one to treat you with
      contempt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never given occasion for it, dearest. I have studiously avoided
      all men, to escape their contempt and scorn. Shame is hard to bear,
      fearfully hard. I felt it today, as his beautiful eyes flashed upon me
      with contempt, as his haughty language crushed me to the earth. This is
      the yoke, Frederick William, that I and my children must bear to our
      graves!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Wilhelmine, not as long as we live&mdash;only while he lives! Wait,
      only wait; let me rise from want and slavery; let the day come which makes
      me free&mdash;which exalts me: my first act will be to lift the yoke from
      you and our children, and woe to those&mdash;a thousand times woe to those
      who would hold it fast! Only be patient, Wilhelmine, submit, and bear with
      me the hard and distressing present. Tell me, my child, my loved one, why
      did you leave Potsdam so suddenly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid, Frederick. A kind of madness seized me at the thought of
      the king&rsquo;s bailiffs carrying me off to Spandau; a nameless anxiety
      confused my mind, and I only realized that I must escape&mdash;that I must
      conceal myself. I felt in greater security here than at Potsdam for the
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you fled without leaving me any sign or message to tell me whither
      you had gone! Oh, Wilhelmine, what if I had not divined your hiding-place,
      and had awaited at Potsdam in painful anxiety?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I should have fled from here at daybreak, leaving my children, and
      in some quiet, obscure retreat have concealed myself from every eye&mdash;even
      your own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you have hidden yourself from me?&rdquo; cried the prince, encircling her
      in his arms, and pressing her to his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Frederick, when your heart did not prompt you where to find me, then
      it would have been a proof that you were indifferent to me. When I cannot
      lean upon your love, then there is no longer any protection or
      abiding-place for me in the world, and the grave will be my refuge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you see my heart revealed you to me, and I am here,&rdquo; said the prince,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Heaven be praised, you have come to me,&rdquo; she cried, exultingly,
      throwing her arms about his neck, and kissing him passionately. &ldquo;You are
      here; I no longer dread the old king&rsquo;s anger, and his fearful words fall
      as spent arrows at my feet. You are here, king of my heart; now I have
      only one thing to dread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, Wilhelmine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent close to his ear, and whispered: &ldquo;I fear that you are untrue to
      me; that there is some ground for truth in those anonymous letters, which
      declare that you would discard me and my children also, for you love
      another&mdash;not one other, but many.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jealousy, again jealous!&rdquo; the prince sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said she, tenderly, &ldquo;I only repeat what is daily written me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you read it?&rdquo; cried the prince, vehemently. &ldquo;Why do you quaff the
      poison which wicked, base men offer you? Why do you not throw such letters
      into the fire, as I do when they slander you to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you know, Frederick,&rdquo; she answered, proudly and earnestly&mdash;&ldquo;you
      must know that that which they write against me is slander and falsehood.
      My life lies open before you; every year, every day, is like an unsullied
      page, upon which but one name stands inscribed&mdash;Frederick William&mdash;not
      Prince Frederick William. What does it benefit me that you are a prince?
      If you were not a prince, I should not be despised, my children would not
      be nameless, without fortune, and without justice. No, were you not a
      prince, I should not have felt ashamed and grief-stricken, with downcast
      eyes, before the lady who drove past in her splendid carriage, while I was
      humbly seated in a miserable wagon. No, were not my beloved a prince, he
      could have made me his wife, could have given me his name, and I should
      to-day be at his side with my children. Then, what benefit is it to me
      that you are a prince? I love you not that you are one, but
      notwithstanding it. And if I love you in spite of all this, you must know
      that my affection is ever-enduring and ever-faithful&mdash;that I can
      never forget you, never abandon you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you believe, Wilhelmine, that I could ever abandon or forsake you?
      Is it not the same with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, sadly answering: &ldquo;No, Frederick, it is unfortunately
      not the same. You have loved me, and perhaps you love me still, but with
      that gentle warmth which does not hinder glowing flames to kindle near it,
      and with their passionate fire overpower the slight warmth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be so for the moment, I grant it,&rdquo; the prince answered,
      thoughtfully; &ldquo;but the quick, blazing fire soon consumes itself, leaving
      only a heap of ashes; then one turns to the gentle warmth with inward
      comfort, and rejoices in its quiet happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You confess loving another?&rdquo; said Wilhelmine, sorrowfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I do not grant that,&rdquo; the prince cried; &ldquo;but you are a sensible,
      clever woman, and you know my heart is easily excited. It is only the
      meteoric light of the ignis fatuus, soon extinguished. Let it dance and
      flicker, but remember that the only warmth which cheers and brightens my
      heart is your love and friendship. You are my first and only love, and you
      will be my last&mdash;that I swear to you, and upon it you can rely. Every
      thing is uncertain and wavering in life. They have ruined me, lacerated my
      heart, and there is nothing more in the world which I honor. Only
      sycophants and hypocrites surround me, who speculate upon my future
      greatness; or spies, who would make their fortune today, and therefore spy
      and hang about me, in order to be paid by the reigning king, and who
      slander me in order to be favorites of his. No one at court loves me, not
      even my wife. How should she? She is well aware that I married her only at
      the command of my royal uncle, and she accepted me almost with
      detestation, for they had related to her the unhappiness of my first
      marriage, and the happiness of my first love! She has learned the story of
      my first wife, Elizabeth von Braunschweig, and that of my only love,
      Wilhelmine Enke! She obeyed, like myself, the stern command of another,
      and we were married, as all princes and princesses are, and we have had
      children, as they do. We lead the life of a political marriage, but the
      heart is unwed. We bow before necessity and duty, and, believe me, those
      are the only household gods in the families of princes. Happy the man who,
      besides these stern divinities, possesses a little secret temple, in which
      he can erect an altar to true love and friendship, and where he can enjoy
      a hidden happiness. This I owe to you, Wilhelmine; you are the only one in
      whom I have confidence, for you have proved to me that you love me without
      self-interest and without ambition. You have said it, and it is true, you
      love me, notwithstanding I am a prince. I confess to you, there are many
      lovely women of the court who are your rivals, and who would try to
      separate us in order to attract me to themselves. They are beautiful and
      seductive, and I am young and passionate; and if these lovely women have
      no respect for my dignity as a married man, how then should I have it, who
      married for duty, not for love? But there is one whom I respect for
      disinterestedness and fidelity! Do you not know who alone is disinterested
      and faithful?&mdash;who has never seen in me the prince, the future king&mdash;only
      the beloved one, the man&mdash;one who has never wavered, never counted
      the cost?&mdash;that you are, Wilhelmine Enke, therefore we are
      inseparable, and you have not to fear that I can ever forsake you, even if
      I am sometimes entangled in the magic nets of other beautiful women. The
      chains which bind us together cannot be torn asunder, for a wonderful
      secret power has consecrated them with the magic of true love&mdash;of
      heart-felt friendship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still they are chains, dearest,&rdquo; sighed Wilhelmine. &ldquo;You have named them
      thus! The chains will at last oppress you, and you will forget the magic
      power which binds you, and will be free. No holy bond, no oath, no
      marriage tie&mdash;nothing but your love binds you to me. I rejoice in it,
      and so long as you do not forsake me, I am conscious that it is your own
      free choice and not force which retains you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will give you an outward sign of our bond of union,&rdquo; cried the prince.
      &ldquo;I will do it today, as a twofold danger hangs over us&mdash;the king
      menaces you, and war menaces me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it then true, do you go with the king to the field?&rdquo; groaned
      Wilhelmine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish me to remain?&rdquo; cried the prince, his eyes flashing. &ldquo;Shall I
      here seek pleasure, with effeminate good nature, while the king, in spite
      of his age, exposes himself to all the fatigue of a campaign and the
      danger of battle? This war of the Bavarian succession is unfortunate, and
      no one knows whether the German empire will derive any important advantage
      from our sustaining by force of arms a little duchy. It is a question
      whether it would not be better to abolish the little principalities, in
      order to strengthen the greater German powers. The king will support
      Bavaria, because he envies Austria its possession, and, as he has decided
      upon war, it becomes his crown prince to yield to his decision without
      murmuring. Therefore, Wilhelmine, I will today witness to you the oath of
      fidelity. If God calls me to Him, if I fall in battle, this oath will be
      your legacy. I have nothing else to leave you, thanks to the parsimony of
      my noble uncle. I am a very poor crown prince, with many debts and little
      money, and not in a condition to reward your love and fidelity otherwise
      than with promises and hopes, and letters of credit for the future. Such a
      bill of exchange I will write for you&mdash;a legacy for my dear
      Wilhelmine. Give me pen and paper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine hastened to her writing table and brought him paper with
      writing materials. &ldquo;There, my Frederick,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;there is every thing
      necessary&mdash;only the ink, I fear, may be dried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince shook his head, smiling. &ldquo;Such a lover&rsquo;s oath as I will
      transcribe for you can be written with no common ink. See, here is my
      ink!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince had suddenly made a slight incision in his arm, and, as the
      blood gushed out, he dipped his pen in it, and wrote; then handed it to
      Wilhelmine, saying: &ldquo;Read it here, in the presence of God and ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine pressed it to her lips, and read, with a solemn voice: &ldquo;&lsquo;By my
      word of honor as a prince, I will never forsake you, and only death shall
      separate you from me.&mdash;Prince Frederick William of Prussia.&rsquo;&rdquo; <i>[Footnote:
      &ldquo;Memoires of the Countess Lichtenau.&rdquo; p. 120.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By my word of honor as a prince, I will never forsake you, and only death
      shall separate me from you,&rdquo; repeated the prince, as he bent over
      Wilhelmine, lifting her in his arms and placing her upon his knee. &ldquo;Take
      the paper and guard it carefully,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;When I die, and you have
      closed my eyes, as I trust you will, give this paper to my son and
      successor, for it is my legacy to you, and I hope my son will honor it and
      recognize in you the wife of my heart, and care for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! speak not of dying, Frederick,&rdquo; cried Wilhelmine, embracing him
      tenderly; &ldquo;may they condemn me, and imprison me as a criminal, when you
      are no more! What matters it to me what befalls me, when I no longer
      possess you, my beloved one, my master? Not on that account will I
      preserve the precious paper, but for the love which it has given me, and
      of which it will one day be a proof to my children. This paper is my
      justification and my excuse, my certificate and my declaration of honor. I
      thank you for it, for it is the most beautiful present that I have ever
      received.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But will you make me no return, Wilhelmine? Will you not swear to me, as
      I have sworn to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the knife from the table without answering, and pointing it to
      her left arm&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, not there!&rdquo; cried the prince, as he sought to stay her hand. &ldquo;Do not
      injure your beautiful arm, it would be a sacrilege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine freed herself from him, as he sought to hold her fast, and in
      the mutual struggle the knife sank deep into her left hand, the blood
      gushing out. <i>[Footnote: The scar of this wound remained her whole life,
      as Wilhelmine relates in her memoirs.&mdash;See &ldquo;Memoires of the Countess
      Lichtenau.&rdquo;]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what have you done?&rdquo; cried the prince, terrified; &ldquo;You are wounded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized her hand and drew the knife from the wound, screaming with
      terror as a clear stream of blood flowed over his own. &ldquo;A physician! Send
      quickly for a physician,&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Where are my servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine closed his lips at this instant with a kiss, and forced herself
      to smile in spite of the pain which the wound caused her. &ldquo;Dearest, it is
      nothing,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have only prepared a great inkstand&mdash;let me
      write!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dipped her pen in the blood, which continued to flow, and wrote
      quickly a few lines, handing them to the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read aloud what you have written. I will hear from your own mouth your
      oath. You shall write it upon my heart with your lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine read: &ldquo;By my love, by the heads of my two children, I swear
      that I will never forsake you&mdash;that I will be faithful to you unto
      death, and will never separate myself from you; that my friendship and
      love will endure beyond the grave; that I will ever be contented and happy
      so long as I may call myself your Wilhelmine Enke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I accept your oath, dearest,&rdquo; said the prince, pressing her to his heart.
      &ldquo;This paper is one of my choicest jewels, and I will never separate myself
      from it. We have now sealed our love and fidelity with our blood, and I
      hope that you will never doubt me again. Remember this hour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she earnestly promised, &ldquo;and I swear to you never to torment and
      torture you again with my jealousy. I shall always know, and shall hold
      fast to it, that you will return to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A violent knocking on the house door interrupted the stillness of the
      night. A voice in loud, commanding tones called to the night-watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am!&rdquo; answered the porter. &ldquo;Who calls me? And what is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the door,&rdquo; commanded the voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is our house,&rdquo; whispered Wilhelmine, who had softly opened the window.
      &ldquo;It is so dark, I can only see a black shadow before the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you belong to the house?&rdquo; asked the night-watch. &ldquo;I dare let no one in
      who does not belong there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lift up your lantern, and look at my livery. It is at the king&rsquo;s order!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine withdrew from the window, and hastened to the prince, who had
      retired to the back part of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Kretzschmar, the king&rsquo;s footman and spy,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Hide
      yourself, that he does not discover you. Go there to the children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Wilhelmine, I will remain here. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine pressed her hand upon his mouth, and forced him into the
      side-room, bolting the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I will meet my fate with courage; whatever may come, it
      shall find me firm and composed. My children are safe, for their father is
      with them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took the light, and hastened into the anteroom, which was resounding
      with the loud ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Who rings so late at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the name of the king, open!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine shoved back the bolt, opening the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and tell me who you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you recognize me,&rdquo; said Kretzschmar, with an impudent smile. &ldquo;You
      have often seen me at Potsdam in company with the king. I saw you this
      morning as the king did you the honor to speak with you, and I believe did
      not compliment you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did his majesty send you here to say this to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not exactly that,&rdquo; answered he, smiling; &ldquo;but, as you asked me, I was
      obliged to answer. I have come here with all speed as courier from
      Potsdam. I hope you will at least give me a good trinkgeld. I was
      commanded to deliver into your own hands this paper, for which I must have
      a receipt.&rdquo; He drew from his breast pocket a large sealed document, which
      he handed to Wilhelmine. &ldquo;Here is the receipt all ready, with the pencil;
      you have only to sign your name, and the business is finished.&rdquo; He
      stretched himself with an air of the greatest ease upon the cane chair,
      near the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine colored with anger at the free conduct of the royal footman,
      and hastened to sign the receipt to rid herself of the messenger, and to
      read the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you give me for trinkgeld, Mamselle Enke?&rdquo; asked the footman,
      as she gave him the receipt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your own rudeness and insult,&rdquo; answered Wilhelmine proudly, as she
      turned, without saluting him, to the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kretzschmar laughed aloud. &ldquo;She will play the great and proud lady,&rdquo; said
      he. &ldquo;She will get over that when in prison. The letter is without doubt an
      order of arrest, for when the king flashes and thunders as he did this
      morning, he usually strikes. I hope it will agree with you.&rdquo; He slowly
      left the anteroom, and descended the stairs to mount his horse, which he
      had bound to a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine hastened in the mean time to the prince. &ldquo;Here is the letter
      addressed to me,&rdquo; said she, handing him the sealed envelope. &ldquo;I beg you to
      open it; courage fails me, everything trembles and swims before my eyes.
      Read it aloud&mdash;I will receive my sentence from your lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince exclaimed, breaking the seal: &ldquo;It is the handwriting of the
      secret cabinet secretary, Menken, and the message comes immediately from
      the king&rsquo;s cabinet. Now, Wilhelmine, do not tremble; lean your head upon
      me, and let us read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;In the name of his majesty, Wilhelmine Enke is commanded, under penalty
      of severe punishment, not to leave her room or her dwelling, until the
      king shall permit her, and send some one to take her and all that belongs
      to her to her place of destination. She shall receive this order with
      patience and humility, and consider her apartment as a prison, which she
      shall not leave under severe penalty, nor allow any one to enter it.
      Whoever may be with her at the time of receiving the order, who do not
      belong there, shall speedily absent themselves, and if the same ride or
      drive to Potsdam, they shall immediately take a message to his royal
      highness the Prince of Prussia, and announce to him that his majesty
      expects him at Sans-Souci at ten o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning. The Minister
      von Herzberg will be in waiting to confer with the prince. The above is
      communicated to Wilhelmine Enke for her strict observance, and she will
      act accordingly.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long silence followed the reading of this letter. Both looked down,
      thoughtfully recalling the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A prisoner,&rdquo; murmured Wilhelmine, &ldquo;a prisoner in my own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for me the peremptory command to leave immediately for Potsdam, in
      order to be at Sans-Souci early in the morning. What can the king mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will announce to you my imprisonment, my exile,&rdquo; sighed Wilhelmine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crown prince shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do not believe it. If
      the king would send you to prison, he would not make such preparation; he
      would not commence with the house arrest, as if you were an officer, who
      had been guilty of some slight insubordination, but he would act with
      decision, as is his wont. He would at once have sent you to Spandau or
      some other prison, and left it to me to have taken further steps. No&mdash;the
      more I think it over, the more evident it is to me that the king is not
      really angry; he will only torment us a little, as it pleases his teasing
      spirit. The chief thing now is to obey, and give him no further occasion
      for anger. You must be very careful not to leave your apartment, or to
      allow any one to enter it. I shall start without delay for Potsdam. There
      are spies posted as well for you as myself; our steps are watched, and an
      exact account of them given. I must away quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Must you leave me a prisoner? Oh, how hard and cruel life is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is, indeed, Wilhelmine. But I must also humbly submit and obey.
      Is not life hard for me, and yet I am crown prince, the heir to the
      throne! I shall be reprimanded and scolded like a footman. I must obey as
      a slave, and am not permitted to act according to my will. I am only a
      mere peg in the great machine which he directs, and the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush! for mercy&rsquo;s sake be quiet! What if some one should hear you? You
      know not if the spies may not be at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the prince, bitterly. &ldquo;I do not know! The nurse even, who
      suckles our child, may be a paid spy. The owner of this house may be in
      the king&rsquo;s service, and creep to the door to listen. Therefore it is
      necessary, above all things, that we act according to the king&rsquo;s commands.
      Farewell, Wilhelmine, I must set off at once. Kretzschmar is no doubt at
      the corner of the street to see whether I, as an obedient servant of his
      master, leave here. If I do it, he will take the news to Sans-Souci, and
      perhaps the king will be contented. Farewell, I go at once to the palace,
      to start from there for Potsdam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, my beloved one! May God in heaven and the king upon earth be
      merciful to us! I will force myself to composure and humility. What I
      suffer is for you! This shall be my consolation. If we never meet again,
      Frederick William, I know you will not forget how much I have loved you!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VI. THE PARADE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since early morning a gay, warlike life had reigned at Potsdam and the
      neighborhood of Sans-Souci. From every side splendid regiments approached,
      with proud and stately bearing, in glittering uniforms, to take in perfect
      order the places assigned to them. With flying banners, drums beating, and
      shrill blasts of trumpets, they came marching on to the great parade&mdash;the
      last, for the king was about to leave for the field. Thousands of
      spectators poured forth, notwithstanding the early hour, from Potsdam; and
      from Berlin even they came in crowds, to take a last look of the soldiers&mdash;of
      their king, who was still the hero at sixty-nine&mdash;the &ldquo;Alto Fritz,&rdquo;
       whom they adored&mdash;though they felt the rigor of his government. It
      was a magnificent spectacle, indeed&mdash;this immense square, filled with
      regiments, their helmets, swords, and gold embroideries glittering in the
      May sun. Officers, mounted on richly caparisoned steeds, drew up in the
      centre, or galloped along the front of the lines, censuring with a
      thundering invective any deviation or irregularity. In the rear of the
      troops stood the equipages of the distinguished spectators on the one
      side, while on the other the people in compact masses swayed to and fro,
      gayly passing judgment upon the different regiments and their generals.
      The people&mdash;that means all those who were not rich enough to have a
      carriage, or sufficiently distinguished to claim a place upon the tribune
      reserved for noble ladies and gentlemen&mdash;here they stood, the
      educated and uneducated, shoemaker and tailor, savant and artist&mdash;a
      motley mixture! Two gentlemen of the high citizen class apparently were
      among the crowd. They were dressed in the favorite style, which, since the
      &ldquo;Sorrows of Werther&rdquo; had appeared, was the fashion&mdash;tight-fitting
      boots, reaching to the knee, with yellow tops; white breeches, over which
      fell the long-bodied green vest; a gray frock with long pointed tails and
      large metal buttons, well-powdered cue, tied with little ribbons,
      surmounted with a low, wide-brimmed hat. Only one of the gentlemen wore
      the gray frock, according to the faultless Werther costume, a young man of
      scarcely thirty years, of fine figure, and proud bearing; a face
      expressive and sympathetic, reminding one of the glorious portraits of men
      which antiquity has bequeathed to us. It seemed like the head of a god
      descended to earth, noble in every feature, full of grace and beauty; the
      slightly Roman nose well marked yet delicate; the broad, thoughtful brow;
      the cheeks flushed with the hue of youth and power; the well-defined chin
      and red lips, expressive of goodness, benevolence, roguery, and
      haughtiness; large, expressive eyes, flashing with the fire which the gods
      had enkindled. His companion was perhaps eight years younger, less
      well-proportioned, still of graceful appearance, in his youthful
      freshness, with frank, cheerful mien, clever, good-natured, sparkling
      eyes, and red, pouting lips, which never liked to cease chatting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See, Wolff! I beg,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;see that old waddling duck,
      Mollendorf. I know the old fellow, he is from Gotha; he imagines himself
      of the greatest importance, and thinks Prussia begets fame and honor from
      his grace. He trumpets forth his own glories at a dinner, and abuses his
      king. He makes Frederick the Great an insignificant little being, that he
      may look over him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unimportant men always do that,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;They would make
      great men small, and think by placing themselves on high pedestals they
      become great. The clown striding through the crowd on his stilts may even
      look over an emperor. But fortunately there comes a time when the dear
      clown must come down from his stilts, and then it is clear to others, if
      not to himself, what little, earth-born snips the men of yesterday are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only look, Wolff, there is just such a moment coming to that stiltsman
      Mollendorf. How the great man stoops, and how small he looks on his gray
      horse, for a greater springs past! Look at him well, Wolff&mdash;we shall
      dine with him, and he does not like to be stared at in the face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that, then, Prince Henry passing?&rdquo; asked Wolff, with animation; &ldquo;That
      little general, who just galloped into the circle with his suite, is that
      the king&rsquo;s brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is just his misfortune that he is the king&rsquo;s brother,&rdquo; answered
      a deep, sonorous voice behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, they beheld a young, elegantly dressed man, in the light gray
      frock and gold-bordered, three-cornered hat, and a Spanish cane, with an
      ivory handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you remark, sir?&rdquo; asked Herr Wolff; his great, brown eyes
      flashing over the pale, intellectual face of the other, so that he was
      quite confused, yet, as if enchanted, could not turn away. &ldquo;What did you
      remark, sir?&rdquo; asked again Herr Wolff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; stammered the other, &ldquo;that I said it was the misfortune of
      the prince that he was the brother only, as he was worthy of being
      mentioned for himself; but I beg, sir, be a little indulgent, and do not
      pry into my very soul with your godlike eyes. It will craze me, and I
      shall run through the streets of Berlin, crying that the Apollo-Belvedere
      has arrived at Potsdam, and invite all the poets and authors to come and
      worship him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; cried the youngest of the two gentlemen,
      laughing. &ldquo;I believe myself it is the Apollo-Belvedere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still, my dear sir, hush, and preserve our incognito,&rdquo; interrupted his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cannot help it, Wolff. Am I to blame that this clever fellow sees
      through your mask, and discovers the divine spark which hides itself under
      a gray Werther costume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray, sir, grant my request, and respect our incognito,&rdquo; begged the
      other, gently but firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, you shall have your way,&rdquo; laughed the other, good-naturedly,
      and turning to the pale young man, who still kept his eyes fixed on Herr
      Wolff in a sort of ecstacy, he said: &ldquo;Let the authors and poets stay in
      Berlin; we will persuade the disguised Apollo to meet them there, and read
      them a lecture, for among the Berlin poets and critics there are wicked
      heretics, who, if the Deity Himself wrote tragedies and verses, would find
      some fault to object to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray tell me, sir, do you think Prince Henry a great man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not the king call him so in his &lsquo;History of the Seven Years&rsquo; War?&rsquo;&rdquo;
       said the stranger. &ldquo;Did he not publicly, in the presence of all his
      generals, say, &lsquo;that Prince Henry was the only general who had not made a
      mistake during the whole war?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe the king will say that of the prince just riding in with
      his suite, after the present war?&rdquo; asked the young man, with earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the Prince of Prussia,&rdquo; answered the other, shaking his head.
      &ldquo;There are men who call this prince the &lsquo;hope of Prussia,&rsquo; and regard him
      as a new Aurora in the clouded sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, sir, do you regard him so?&rdquo; cried Herr Wolff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that the Prince of Prussia will usher in a brighter day for
      Germany?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the other. &ldquo;I believe that day expires with Frederick the
      Great, and that a long night of darkness will succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it is the course of nature that darkness succeeds light. Look at
      the prince, gentlemen&mdash;the divine light of genius is not stamped upon
      his brow, as formerly, and care will be taken that it is soon extinguished
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will take care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those who are the enemies of light, civilization, and freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; asked Herr Wolff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other smiled, and answered: &ldquo;Sir, so far as I, in all humility, call
      myself a scholar, I also owe to the god Apollo obedience, and must answer
      him, though it may endanger me. I answer, then, the enemies of light and
      civilization are the disguised Jesuits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is easy to perceive that you do not belong to them, or you would
      not thus characterize them, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A mighty flourish of drums, and shrill blasts of horns and trumpets,
      drowned the youth&rsquo;s words, and made all further conversation impossible.
      The king, followed by a brilliant suite, had just arrived at the parade.
      The regiments greeted their sovereign with loud blasts of trumpets, and
      the people shouted their farewell. Frederick lifted lightly his hat, and
      rode along the ranks of the well-ordered troops. He listened to the shouts
      with calm, composed manner; the Jupiter-flashes from his great eyes seemed
      to be spent forever. Mounted upon Caesar, his favorite horse, he looked
      today more bent, his back more bowed with the burden of years; and it was
      plainly visible that the hand which held the staff crosswise over the
      horse&rsquo;s neck, holding at the same time the bridle, trembled from very
      weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is Frederick,&rdquo; said Herr Wolff to himself. &ldquo;That is the hero before
      whom Europe has trembled; the daring prince who caused the sun to rise
      upon his country, and awaken the spirits to cheerful life. Oh, how
      lamentable; how much to be regretted, that a hero, too, can grow feeble
      and old! Oh, cruel fate, that the noblest spirits embodied in this fragile
      humanity, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he ceased, and looked at the king amazed and with admiration. The
      old man had become the hero again. The bowed form was erect, the face
      beamed with energy and conscious power, the eyes flashed with bold daring,
      strong and sonorous was the voice. The king had turned to his generals,
      who were drawn up around him in a large circle, saying: &ldquo;Gentlemen, I come
      to take leave of you. We shall meet again upon the battle-field, where
      laurels bloom for the brave. I hope that we may all return, crowned with
      fresh laurels. Tell my soldiers that I count upon them&mdash;that I know
      they will prove the glory of the Prussian troops anew, and that on the day
      of battle they will see me at their head.&mdash;Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long live the king!&rdquo; cried the generals and staff officers, in one voice.
      The people and the soldiers joined the shout, the ladies waved their
      handkerchiefs. Herr Wolff and his companions tore off their hats with
      enthusiasm, and swung them high in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great eyes of the king, who passed at this moment, rested upon Herr
      Wolff. &ldquo;My heart quaked as if I were the pillar of Memnon, and had been
      touched by the sun&rsquo;s rays,&rdquo; sighed he, as he followed the king with his
      fiery glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ceremony is now finished,&rdquo; said the young man near him, &ldquo;and we must
      leave, in order to be punctual to dinner at Prince Henry&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish the king had remained an hour longer,&rdquo; sighed Herr Wolff again.
      &ldquo;As I looked at him, it seemed as if I were listening to a song from
      Homer, and all my faculties were in unison in delight and enthusiasm.
      Happy those who dare approach him, and remain near him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, according to your opinion, his servants must be very fortunate,&rdquo;
       said the stranger, &ldquo;and yet they say that he is not very kind to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because the servant is a little man,&rdquo; cried Herr Wolff, &ldquo;and every one
      looks little to his belittling eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there are many others no more elevated than servants in the king&rsquo;s
      surroundings,&rdquo; said the other. The youth reminded him that they must
      leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only wait a moment, friend,&rdquo; begged Herr Wolff, as he turned to the
      stranger, saying, &ldquo;I would like to continue our conversation of today. You
      live in Berlin. I will find you out if you will give me your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you to visit me; my name is Moritz. I live in Kloster Strasse,
      near the gray convent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your name is Moritz?&rdquo;, asked Herr Wolff, earnestly. &ldquo;Then you are the
      author of the &lsquo;Journey to England?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the same, and my highest encomium is, that the work is not unknown
      to you, or the name of the author.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All Germany knows it, and do you think I could possibly remain a stranger
      to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your name, sir,&rdquo; said the stranger, with anxious curiosity. &ldquo;Will you
      not give me your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you when we are in your own room,&rdquo; said Herr Wolff, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The air is yet enchanted and intoxicated with the breath of the Great
      Frederick; it should not be desecrated with another name.&mdash;Farewell,
      we will meet in Berlin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not far from these gentlemen stood two others, wrapped in long military
      cloaks, both of striking and foreign appearance; the one, of slight
      delicate figure, of dark complexion, noble and handsome face, must be an
      Italian, as his very black hair and eyes betrayed; the other, tall,
      broad-shouldered, of Herculean stature, belonged to North Germany, as the
      blond hair, light blue eyes, and features indicated. A pleasing smile
      played around his thick, curled lips, and only when he glanced at his
      companion did it die away, and change to one of respectful devotion. At
      this instant the king passed. The Italian pressed the arm of his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The arch fiend himself,&rdquo; he murmured softly, &ldquo;the demon of unbelief, to
      whom nothing is sacred, and nothing intimidates. The contemptuously
      smiling spirit of negation, which is called enlightenment, and is but
      darkness, to whom belief is superstition, and enlightening only deception.
      Woe to him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woe to him!&rdquo; repeated the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was followed by his brilliant and select staff in motley
      confusion. First, Prince Henry, and then the Prince of Prussia. As the
      latter passed the two gentlemen, the Italian pressed the arm of his
      companion still harder. &ldquo;Look at him attentively, my son,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that
      is our future and our hope in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Hercules turned hastily, with a look of astonishment, to the Italian.
      &ldquo;The Prince of Prussia?&rdquo; asked he, with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Italian nodded. &ldquo;Do you doubt it?&rdquo; he added, reproachfully. &ldquo;Would you
      doubt your lord and master, because he reveals to you what you cannot
      seize with your clouded spirit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, master, I am only surprised that you hope for good from this
      lost-in-sin successor to the throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are poor, human children,&rdquo; sighed the Italian, compassionately
      smiling; &ldquo;prompt to judge, mistaking light for darkness, and darkness for
      light. I have already remarked that to the celebrated and austere Minister
      Sully, as he complained to me of the levity and immorality of the French
      king, Henry IV. I told him that austere morals and moral laws suffered
      exceptions, and that those through whom the welfare of humanity should be
      furthered, had to transfer their heavenly bliss of love to the earthly
      sphere. Sully would contest the question with me, but I defeated him,
      while I repeated to him what the beautiful and unhappy Queen of Scotland,
      Mary Stuart, once said to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Stuart!&rdquo; cried the other, vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mary Stuart,&rdquo; answered the Italian, earnestly. &ldquo;Come, my son, let us
      go. We have seen what we wished to see, and that is sufficient. Give me
      thy arm, and let us depart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They departed arm in arm, withdrawing from the crowd, and taking the broad
      walk which crossed to the park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were about to relate to me the answer which Mary Stuart gave to you,
      sir,&rdquo; said the Hercules, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True; I will now relate it to you,&rdquo; he answered, with sadness. &ldquo;It was in
      Edinburgh I had surprised Mary (as I was admitted without ceremony), in
      her boudoir, as the handsome Rizzio sat at her feet, and sang love-songs
      to her. She was resting upon a gold-embroidered divan, and her figure
      appeared to great advantage in the heavenly blue, silver-embroidered gauze
      robe, which covered her beautiful limbs like a cloud. In her hair sparkled
      two diamonds, like two stars fallen from heaven, and more glowing still
      were her eyes, which tenderly rested upon Rizzio. Leaning upon her elbow,
      she inclined toward Rizzio, who, lute in hand, was looking up to her with
      a countenance expressive of the deepest love. It was a glorious picture,
      this young and charming couple, in their bliss of love; and never, in the
      course of this century, have I forgotten this exquisite picture&mdash;never
      have its bright tints faded from my memory. How often have I begged my
      friend, Antonio Vandyck, to make this picture eternal, with his immortal
      pencil. He promised to do it, but at the moment he was occupied with the
      portraits of Charles I. and his family&mdash;the grandson of Queen Mary.
      Later, as I was not with him, unfortunately, to save him, death seized him
      before he had fulfilled his promise. But her image is stamped upon my
      heart, and I see her now, as I saw her then, the beautiful queen, with the
      handsome singer at her feet. I had entered unawares, and stood a few
      moments at the door before they remarked me. As I approached, Rizzio
      suddenly ceased in the midst of a tender passage, and sprang to his feet.
      Mary signed to him, blushing, to withdraw. He glided noiselessly out, his
      lute under his arm, and I remained alone with the queen. I dared to chide
      her, gently, for her love affair with the handsome singer, and, above all,
      to exhort her to fidelity to her husband. Whereupon Mary answered me, with
      her accustomed smiling manner, &lsquo;There is but one fidelity which one must
      recognize, and that is to the god of gods&mdash;Love! Where he is not, I
      will not be. The god Hymen is a tedious, pedantic fellow, who burns to
      ashes all the fresh young love of the heart, and all the enthusiasm of the
      soul, with his intolerable tallow torch, for Love stands not at his side.
      I am faithful to the god Amor, therefore I can never be faithful to the
      god Hymen, as it would be unfaithful to Love!&rsquo; That was the response of
      the beautiful Queen Mary. I could not contest the question, so I only
      looked at her and smiled. Suddenly, I felt a dagger, as it were, thrust at
      my heart, my spiritual eyes were opened, the lovely woman on the divan was
      fearfully changed. Instead of the gauze robe, sparkling with silver, a
      black cloth dress covered her emaciated limbs; instead of brilliants,
      sparkling in her hair, a mourning veil covered her whitened locks. The
      beauty and roundness of her neck had disappeared, and I saw around it a
      broad dark-red stripe. Her head moved, and fell at my feet dissevered. I
      saw it all, as distinctly as if it really happened, and seized with
      unspeakable pity I prostrated myself at her feet (who was unknowing of my
      vision), and besought her with all the anxiety and tenderness of
      friendship to leave Scotland, to fly from England, as there the
      death-tribunal awaited her. But Mary Stuart only laughed at my warning,
      and called me a melancholy fool, whom jealousy made prophetic. The more I
      begged and implored, the more wanton and gay the poor woman became. Then,
      as I saw all persuasion was vain, that no one could save her from her
      dreadful fate, I took a solemn oath that I would be at her side at the
      hour of her peril, and accompany her to the scaffold. Mary laughed aloud,
      and, with that mocking gayety so peculiarly her own, she accepted the
      oath, and reached me her white hand, sparkling with diamonds, to seal the
      vow with a kiss. I faithfully kept it. I had but just arrived in Rome when
      I received the account of her imprisonment. I presented myself immediately
      to the pope, the great Sixtus V., who then occupied the chair of St.
      Peter. Fortunately, he was my friend, and I had formerly been useful to
      him, in assisting him to carry out his great and liberal ideas for the
      welfare of humanity. As a return, I prayed the Holy Father to give me a
      consecrated hostie for the unhappy Queen Mary Stuart, and the permission
      to carry it to her in her prison. The Holy Father was incredulous of my
      sad presentiments, as Mary Stuart herself had been, but he granted me the
      request. I quitted Rome, and travelled with relays day and night. Reaching
      Boulogne, a Dover packet-boat had just raised anchor; I succeeded in
      boarding her, and arrived in London the next evening. The day following,
      the execution of the queen took place at Fotheringay. I was with her in
      her last hours, and from my hand she received the consecrated water of
      Pope Sixtus V. I had kept my oath. I accompanied her to the scaffold, and
      her head rolled at my feet, as I had seen it in my vision at Edinburgh. It
      was the 18th of April, 1587, and it seems to me as but yesterday. To the
      intuitive, seeing spirit, time and space disappear; eternity and
      immortality are to it omnipresent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Given up to his souvenirs and visions, the Italian appeared not to know
      where he wandered, and turned unintentionally to the retired, lonely
      places in the park. His companion heeded not the way either, occupied with
      the strange account of the Italian. A dreadful feeling of awe and horror
      took possession of his soul, and, with devoted respect, he hung upon the
      words which fell from the lips of his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in the year 1587,&rdquo; said he, as the Italian ceased; &ldquo;almost two
      hundred years since, and you were present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Italian replied: &ldquo;I was present. I have witnessed so many dreadful
      scenes, and been present at so many executions, that this sad spectacle
      was not an unusual one to me, and would not have remained fixed in my
      memory had I not loved, devotedly and fervently, the beautiful Queen Mary
      Stuart. For those who live in eternity, all horrors have ceased; time
      rushes past in centuries, which seem to them but a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teach me so to live, master; I thirst for knowledge,&rdquo; cried his
      companion, fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, my son; I penetrate thy soul, and I know that thou thirstest.
      Therefore I am here to quench thy thirst, and feed thy hungry heart.&rdquo; He
      remained standing upon the grass-plot, which he had reached by lonely
      paths, and which was encircled by trees and bushes. Not a sound
      interrupted the peaceful morning stillness of the place, except the
      distant music of the departing regiments dying away on the air. &ldquo;I will
      teach thee to live in eternity!&rdquo; resumed the Italian, solemnly. &ldquo;My
      predecessor the apostle, George Schrepfer, has initiated thee in temporal
      life, and the knowledge of the present. By the pistol-shot, which
      disclosed to him the invisible world, and removed him from our earthly
      eyes, has he to thee, his most faithful and believing disciple, given the
      great doctrine of the decay of all things earthly, and prepared thee for
      the doctrine of the imperishableness of the celestial. The original of
      humanity sends me, to make known to thee this holy doctrine. When I met
      thee in Dresden, at the side of the Countess Dorothea von Medem, thee,
      whom I had never seen, I recognized by the blue flame which trembled above
      thy head, and which was nothing else than the soul of thy teacher,
      Schrepfer, wrestling in anguish, which has remained with thee, and hopes
      for delivery from thee. I greeted thee, therefore, not as a stranger but
      as a friend. No one called thy name, and yet it was known to me. I took
      thee by the hand, greeting thee. Hans Rudolph von Bischofswerder, be
      welcome. The blue flame which glows upon thy brow, guides me to thee, and
      the pistol-shot under the oaks centuries old, at Rosenthal, near Leipsic,
      was the summons which my spirit received among the pyramids of Egypt, and
      which recalled me to Europe, to my own, and thou art one of them.&ldquo;<i>[Footnote:
      George Schrepfer, the founder of the Secret Free Mason Lodge (at the same
      time proprietor of a restaurant and a conjuror), invited his intimate
      disciples and believers in the year 1774, to whom Bischofswerder belonged,
      to meet him at Rosenthal, near Leipsic. He assembled them around him,
      beneath some old oaks, to take leave of them, as now he would render
      himself in the invisible realm, whence, as a spirit, he would distribute
      to some of his disciples gold, to others wisdom. He then commanded them to
      conceal their faces and pray. The praying ones suddenly heard a loud
      report, and, as they looked up Schrepfer fell dead. He had shot himself
      with a pistol.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as thou spakest, oh master, I recognized thee, and I called&mdash;&rsquo; 
      Thou art here, who hast been announced to me. Thou art the master, and my
      master Schrepfer was the prophet, who preceded thee and prophesied thee.
      Thou art the great Kophta&mdash;thou art Count Alexander Cagliostro!&rsquo; As I
      uttered the name, the lights were extinguished, deep darkness and profound
      stillness reigned. The two countesses Dorothea von Medem and her sister,
      Eliza von der Necke, clung trembling to me, neither of them daring to
      break the silence even with a sigh. Suddenly the darkness disappeared,
      and, with trembling flashes of light, there stood written on the wall:
      &lsquo;Memento Domini Oagliostro et omnis mansuetudinis ejus.&rsquo; We sank upon our
      knees, and implored thee to aid us. By degrees the strange, secret
      characters disappeared, and darkness and silence reigned. The stillness
      disquieted me at last, and I called for lights. As the servant entered,
      the two countesses lay fainting upon the floor, and thou hadst
      disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only to appear to thee at another time,&rdquo; said Cagliostro, &ldquo;to receive
      thee with solemn ceremonies into the magic circle&mdash;to initiate thee
      in the secret wisdom of spirits, and prepare thee for the invisible lodge.
      Recall what I said to thee, three days since, in Dresden. Do you still
      remember it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I recall it. Thou saidst: &lsquo;The secret service calls me to Mittau, with
      the Countess Medem, to raise hidden treasure, of which the spirit has
      given me knowledge, and decipher important magical characters on the walls
      of a cloister. Before I leave, I will lead thee upon the way which thou
      hast to follow in order to find the light, and let it illuminate the soul
      which is worthy. Follow me, and I will lead thee to the path of glory,
      power, and immortality.&rsquo; These were thy words, master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have now led thee hither,&rdquo; Cagliostro said to him, gently; &ldquo;thy soul
      doubts and trembles, for thou art blind seeing eyes, and deaf with hearing
      ears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My soul doubts not, oh master&mdash;it comprehends not. I have followed
      thee, devotedly and believingly. Thou knowest it, master, for thou readest
      the souls of thy children, and seest their hidden thoughts. Thou hast said
      to me in Dresden, &lsquo;Renounce your service to the Duke of Courland.&rsquo; I did
      it, and from equerry and lord chamberlain to the duke, became a simple,
      private gentleman. I have renounced my titles and dignities for thee, in
      happy trust in thee. My future lies in thy hands, and, anxious to learn
      the mysteries of immortality, as a grateful, trustful scholar, I would
      receive happiness and unhappiness at thy hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt receive not only happiness,&rdquo; said Cagliostro, solemnly, &ldquo;but
      thou art one of the elect. The blue flame glows upon thy brow, it will
      illuminate thy soul, and lead thee to the path of glory, power, and might.
      To-day thou art a simple, private gentleman, as thou sayst, but to-morrow
      thou wilt become a distinguished lord, before whom hundreds will bow. Fame
      awaits thee&mdash;which thou hast longed for&mdash;as power awaits thee.
      Whom have I named to thee as our future and our hope in this land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Frederick William of Prussia,&rdquo; answered Herr von Bischofswerder,
      humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I spake this name, thou trembledst, and calledst him &lsquo;one lost in
      sin.&rsquo; Knowest thou, my son, from sin comes penitence, and from penitence
      elevation and purification. Thou art called and chosen to convert sinners,
      and lead back the earth-born child to heaven. Engrave these words upon thy
      memory, fill thy soul with them, as with glowing flames, repeat them in
      solitude the entire day, then heavenly spirits will arise and whisper the
      revelations of the future. Then, when thou art consecrated, I will
      introduce thee into the sacred halls of sublime wisdom. Thou shalt be
      received as a scholar in the temple hall, and it depends upon thee whether
      thou advancest to the altar which reaches to the invisible world of
      miracles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, master,&rdquo; cried Bisehofswerder, with a countenance beaming with joy,
      and sinking upon his knees, &ldquo;wilt thou favor me, and introduce me to the
      temple hall? Shall I be received in the sacred world of spirits?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt, Hans Rudolph von Bischofswerder. The grand master of our
      order will bestow upon thee this happiness, and to-night shall the star of
      the future rise over thee. Hold thyself in readiness. At midnight, present
      thyself at the first portal of the royal palace in Berlin. A man will meet
      thee, and thou shalt ask, &lsquo;Who is our hope?&rsquo; If he answers thee, &lsquo;The
      Prince of Prussia,&rsquo; then he is the messenger which I shall have sent thee&mdash;follow
      him. Bow thy head in humility, shut thine eyes to all earthly things, turn
      thy thoughts inward, and lift them up to the great departed, which hovers
      over thy head, and speak with the blue flame which glows upon thy brow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bischofswerder bowed still lower, covered his face with his hands, as if
      inwardly praying, and knelt. Cagliostro bent over him, laid his hand upon
      his head, breathing three times upon his blond hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have breathed upon thee with the breath of my spirit,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Thy
      spirit receives power. Receive it in holy awe, in devotion, and remain
      immovable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bischofswerder continued motionless, with bowed head and concealed face.
      Cagliostro raised himself, his black eyes fixed upon his disciple, and
      noiselessly disappeared. Herr von Bischofswerder still remained kneeling.
      After some time he raised his head, shyly looking about, and, as he found
      himself alone, he rose. &ldquo;He has soared away,&rdquo; he murmured, softly. &ldquo;I
      shall see him again, and he will consecrate me&mdash;the consecration of
      immortals!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII. THE MIRACULOUS ELIXIR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king withdrew from the parade slowly, followed by his generals, in the
      direction of Sans-Souci. The streets of Potsdam were lined with the
      people, shouting their farewell to the king, who received them with a
      smiling face. Arriving at the grand entrance, he turned to his suite,
      saying, &ldquo;Gentlemen, we shall meet again in Bohemia; I must now take leave
      of you, and forego the pleasure of receiving you again to-day. A king
      about to leave for the field has necessary arrangements to make for the
      future. I have much to occupy me, as I set out early to-morrow morning.
      You, also, have duties to attend to. Farewell, gentlemen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his worn-out three-cornered hat, saluted his generals with a
      slight inclination of the head, and turned into the broad avenue which led
      to the park of Sans-Souci. No one followed him but two mounted footmen,
      who rode at a respectful distance, attentively regarding the king, of whom
      only the bowed back and hat were visible. Half way down the avenue his
      staff was raised above his hat, the sign the footmen awaited to dismount
      with the greyhounds, which rode before them upon the saddle. At the shrill
      barking of the animals, Frederick reined in his horse, and turned to look
      for them. They bounded forward, one upon each side of the king, who
      regarded them right and left, saying: &ldquo;Well, Alkmene, well Diana, let us
      see who will be the lady of honor to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both dogs sprang with loud barking to the horse, as if understanding the
      words of their master. Alkmene, stronger, or more adroit, with one bound
      leaped to the saddle; while poor Diana landed upon the crouper, and, as if
      ashamed, with hanging head and tail, withdrew behind the horse. &ldquo;Alkmene
      has won!&rdquo; said Kretzschmar to his companion. &ldquo;Yes, Alkmene is the
      court-lady to-day, and Diana the companion,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;She will be
      cross, and I do not blame her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Kretzschmar; &ldquo;there is a great difference between the
      court-lady and the companion. The lady remains with the king all day; he
      plays with her, takes her to walk, gives her bonbons, and the choice
      morsels of chicken, and only when she has eaten sufficient, can the
      companion enter to eat the remainder.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: This was the daily
      order of rank with the favorite dogs, for whose service two dog-lackeys,
      as they were called, were always in waiting. They took them to walk.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One could almost envy the king&rsquo;s greyhounds!&rdquo; sighed the second footman.
      &ldquo;We get dogs&rsquo; wages, and they the chicken and good treatment. It is a
      pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The worst of it is, the king forbids us to marry!&rdquo; said Kretzschmar
      sadly. &ldquo;All the others would leave him, but I pay no attention to old
      Fritz&rsquo;s snarling and scolding, for he pays for it afterward; first, it
      rains abusive words, then dollars, and if the stupid ass hits me over the
      head, he gives me at least a ducat for it. Why should not one endure
      scoldings when is well paid for it? I remain the fine handsome fellow that
      I am, if the old bear does call me an ass! His majesty might well be
      satisfied if he had my fine figure and good carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, we are very different fellows from old Fritz!&rdquo; said the
      second lackey, with a satisfied air. &ldquo;A princess once thought me a
      handsome fellow! It is eleven years since, as I entered the guards on
      account of my delicate figure. I was guard of honor in the anteroom of the
      former crown princess of Prussia. It was my first experience. I did not
      know the ways of the lords and ladies. Suddenly, a charming and
      beautifully-dressed lady came into the anteroom, two other young ladies
      following her, joking and laughing, quite at their pleasure. All at once
      the elegantly-attired lady fixed her large black eyes upon me, so
      earnestly, that I grew quite red, and looked down. &lsquo;See that handsome
      boy,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;I will bet that it is a girl dressed up!&rsquo; She ran up to
      me, and began to stroke my cheek with her soft hand, and laughed. &lsquo;I am
      right. He has not the trace of a beard; it is a girl!&rsquo; And before I knew
      it she kissed me, then again, and a third time even. I stood still as if
      enchanted, and, as I thought another kiss was coming, whack went a stout
      box on my ear. &lsquo;There is a punishment for you,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;that you may
      know enough to return a kiss when a handsome lady gives you when the king
      did not wish them with him; in summer, in an open wagon, the dogs upon the
      back-seat, and the footmen upon the forward seat, and whenever they
      reproved them, to bring them to order, they addressed them in the polite
      manner of one, and not stand like a libber,&rsquo; and with that she boxed me
      again. The other two ladies laughed, which made me angry, and my ears were
      very warm. &lsquo;If that happens again,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;by thunder, she will find I
      do not wait to be punished!&rsquo; I laid down the arms, and at once sprang
      after the lady, when&mdash;the folding-doors were thrown open, and two
      gentlemen, in splendid gold-embroidered dresses, entered. As they saw the
      little lady, they stood astonished, and made the three prescribed bows. I
      smelt the rat, and put on my sword quickly, and stood stiff as a puppet.
      The gentlemen said, that they must beg an interview with her royal
      highness, to deliver the king&rsquo;s commands. The princess went into an
      adjoining room. One of the court-ladies stopped before me a moment, and
      said: &lsquo;If you ever dare to tell of this, you shall be put in the fortress.
      Remember it, and keep silent.&rsquo; I did so, and kept it a secret until
      to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the princess ever punish you again?&rdquo; asked Kretzchmar, with a bold,
      spying look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, never,&rdquo; answered the lackey Schultz. &ldquo;The princess was ordered to
      Stettin the next day, where she still lives as a prisoner for her gay
      pranks. I remembered her punishment, and when a lady has kissed me, I have
      bravely returned it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footmen had followed the king up the slowly ascending horse-path to
      the terrace, and now they sprang quickly forward. Kretzschmar swung
      himself from his saddle, threw Schultz the reins, and, as the king drew up
      at the side-door of the palace of Sans-Souci, he stood ready to assist him
      to dismount. The king had given strict orders that no one should notice
      his going or coming, and to-day, as usual, he entered without pomp or
      ceremony into his private room, followed by Kretzschmar alone. He sank
      back into his armchair, the blue damask covering of which was torn and
      bitten by the dogs, so that the horse-hair stood out from the holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now relate to me, Kretzschmar, how your expedition succeeded. Did you go
      to Berlin to see Mademoiselle Enke last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your majesty, I was there, and have brought you the writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she alone?&rdquo; asked the king, bending over to caress Alkmene, who lay
      at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; answered Kretzschmar, grinning, &ldquo;I do not know whether she was
      alone or not. I only know that, as I waited a little on the corner of the
      street, I saw a gentleman go out, wrapped in a cloak, a tall,
      broad-shouldered gentleman, whom I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom you naturally did not recognize,&rdquo; said the king, interrupting him;
      &ldquo;it was a dark night, and no moon, so that you could not see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your service, your majesty, I could see no one; I would only add that
      the unknown may have been at Mademoiselle Enke&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he may not have been,&rdquo; cried the king, harshly. &ldquo;What else did you
      learn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all worth speaking about. Only one thing I must say, the
      lackey Schultz is a prattling fool, and speaks very disrespectfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he talk with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your majesty, with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he knows well that it would be welcome. What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He related to me a love-affair with the crown princess of Prussia eleven
      years since. He plumes himself upon the crown princess having stroked his
      beard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet!&rdquo; commanded the king, harshly. &ldquo;If Schultz was drunk, and talked
      in a crazy manner, how dare you repeat it to me? Let this happen again,
      and I will dismiss you my service. Remember it, you ass!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, your majesty, I thought I must relate all that I hear of
      importance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was not important, and not worth the trouble of talking about. If
      Schultz is such a drunken fellow I did not know it, and he is to be
      pitied. You can go now; I give you a day to make your farewells to your
      friends, and to console them with the hope of meeting you again. Put every
      thing in order that concerns you. If you have debts, pay them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no money to pay them, your majesty,&rdquo; sighed Kretzschmar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king stepped to the iron coffer, of which no one possessed the key but
      himself, and looking within said: &ldquo;You cannot have much money to-day, as
      the drawer which contains the money for the gossips and spies is quite
      empty, and you have had a good share of it. Five guldens remain for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! your majesty, it is too little; twenty-five guldens would not pay
      my debts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king closed the drawer, saying: &ldquo;Judas only received twenty shillings
      for betraying his Master. Twenty-five is quite enough for Kretzschmar for
      betraying his comrade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kretzschmar slunk away. The king fixed his great eyes upon him until the
      door closed. &ldquo;Man is a miserable race; for gold he would sell his own
      brother&mdash;would sell his own soul, if there could be found a
      purchaser,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Why do you growl, Alkmene, why trouble yourself,
      mademoiselle? I was not speaking of your honorable race; only of the
      pitiful race of men. Be quiet, my little dog, be quiet; I love you, and
      you are my dear little dog,&rdquo; he said, pressing her caressingly to his
      breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman Schultz appeared to announce the equerry Von Schwerin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bid him enter,&rdquo; nodded the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Schwerin entered, with a smiling face. &ldquo;Have you accomplished what I
      confided to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a profound bow Von Schwerin drew a roll of paper from his
      breast-pocket, and handed it to the king, saying, &ldquo;I am so fortunate as to
      have accomplished your commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will Count Schmettau give up the villa at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your majesty, the new occupant could take possession to-day, with
      all the furniture and house arrangements, for seven thousand five hundred
      dollars. Here is the bill of sale, only the purchaser&rsquo;s name is wanting. I
      have obeyed your majesty&rsquo;s commands, and acted as if I were the
      purchaser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Schmettau is not such a stupid fellow as to believe that, for he knows
      that you cannot keep your money. You say the contract is ready, only the
      signature of the purchaser is wanting and the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, your majesty, the name of the present possessor has not been
      inserted. I did not presume to write it without the unmistakable command
      of your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the name?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not, but the generosity of my most gracious king and master allows
      me to divine it, and my heart is filled to bursting with thankfulness and
      joy. My whole life will not be long enough to prove to you my gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked the king, staring at Von Schwerin, quite surprised; &ldquo;you
      cannot suppose that I have purchased the villa for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr von Schwerin smilingly nodded. &ldquo;I think so, your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frederick laughed aloud. &ldquo;Schwerin, you are an uncommonly cunning fellow.
      You see the grass grow before the seed is sown. This time you deceived
      yourself&mdash;the grass has not grown. What good would it do you? You do
      not need grass, but thistles, and they do not grow at Charlottenburg. Take
      the contract to my minister Von Herzberg, whom you will find in the
      audience-room, and then walk a little upon the terrace to enjoy the fresh
      air. I promised you the privilege. First go to Von Herzberg, and say to
      him to send the Prince of Prussia to me immediately upon his arrival. Why
      do you wear so mournful a face all of a sudden? Can it be possible that my
      chief equerry has so lowered himself as to go among the mechanics, and
      build chateaux en Espagne? You know such houses are not suitable for our
      northern climate, and fall down. Now, do what I told you, and then go upon
      the terrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The equerry glided away with sorrowful mien to Von Herzberg, and
      communicated the king&rsquo;s commands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have made a good purchase,&rdquo; said the minister, in a friendly manner.
      &ldquo;His majesty will be very much pleased with the extraordinary zeal and the
      great dexterity with which you have arranged the matter. Count Schmettau
      has just been here, and he could not sufficiently commend your zeal and
      prudence, and the sympathy and interest which you showed in the smallest
      matters, as if the purchase were for yourself. The count wishes to reserve
      two oil paintings in the saloon, which are an heirloom from his father. We
      cannot but let the count retain them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrange it as you will,&rdquo; answered the equerry, fretfully; &ldquo;I have nothing
      more to do with the affair&mdash;it lies in your hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where are you going in such haste?&rdquo; said Herzberg, as the equerry
      bowed hastily, and strode through the room toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His majesty commanded me to go upon the terrace,&rdquo; he replied, morosely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr von Herzberg looked after him surprised. &ldquo;Something must have
      occurred, otherwise he is very tractable. Ah! there comes the prince. I
      will go to meet him, and communicate to him the king&rsquo;s command&mdash;I
      will await your royal highness here until you have spoken with the king,
      if you will have the grace to seek me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will return by all means, if you will have the kindness to wait for
      me,&rdquo; replied the prince, smiling, and hastened to the interview with his
      royal uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederick was seated in his arm-chair, upon his lap Alkmene, when the
      crown prince entered. &ldquo;Bon jour, mon neveu! pardon me,&rdquo; said he, with a
      friendly nod, &ldquo;that I remain seated, and do not rise to greet the future
      King of Prussia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, Heaven grant that many years pass before I succeed to the title
      which my great and unapproachable predecessor has borne with so much
      wisdom and fame, that one can well doubt the being able to emulate his
      example, and must content himself to live under the shadow of his
      intelligence and fame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frederick slowly shook his head. &ldquo;The people will not be satisfied, nor
      the coffers filled by fame. No one can live upon the great deeds of his
      ancestors; he must be self-sustaining, not seek for the laurels in the
      past, but upon the naked field of the future, which lies before him. Sow
      the seeds of future laurels; fame troubles me but little, and I advise
      you, my nephew, not to rely upon it. One must begin anew each day, and
      make fresh efforts for vigorous deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crown prince bowed, and seated himself upon the tabouret, which the
      king, with a slight wave of the hand, signified to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will endeavor, sire, to follow the elevated sentiments of your majesty,
      that I may not dishonor my great teacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You express yourself too modestly, my nephew, and I know that you think
      otherwise; that your fiery spirit will never be contented to dishonor
      yourself or your ancestors. Fate is favorable to you, and offers the
      opportunity to confirm, what I judge you to be&mdash;a brave soldier, a
      skilful captain&mdash;in a word, a true Hohenzollern! I would make you a
      commander of a division of my army, and I shall follow every movement&mdash;every
      operation, with lively interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A ray of joy beamed upon the face of the prince; Frederick saw it with
      satisfaction, and his heart warmed toward his nephew. &ldquo;He has at least
      courage,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;he is no sybarite to quail before the rough
      life of war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your majesty so greatly favor me as to accord me an independent
      position in the campaign?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offer you what belongs to you as a general and heir to the throne. On
      me it devolves to direct the plans and operations, and on you to detail
      them and direct the execution. I shall rejoice to see that you understand
      the profession of war practically as well as theoretically. Therefore,
      this war is so far welcome, that it will give my crown prince an
      opportunity to win his first laurels, and adorn the brow which, until now,
      has been crowned with myrtle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be silent&mdash;I do not reproach you, my nephew; I understand human
      nature, and the seductive arts of women. It is time that you seek other
      ornament&mdash;myrtle becomes a youthful brow, and the helmet adorns the
      man crowned with laurels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have long desired it, and I am deeply grateful to your majesty for the
      opportunity to win it. This campaign is good fortune to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;War is never a good fortune,&rdquo; sighed the king&mdash;&ldquo;for the people it is
      great misfortune. I would willingly have avoided it for their sake. But
      the arrogance and the passion for territorial aggrandizement of the young
      Emperor of Germany forces me to it. I dare not, and will not suffer
      Austria to enrich herself through foreign inheritance, ignoring the
      legitimate title of a German prince. Bavaria must remain an independent,
      free German principality, under a sovereign prince. It is inevitably
      necessary for the balance of power. I cannot yield, therefore, as a German
      prince, that Austria increase her power in an illegitimate manner, but I
      will cast my good sword in the scales, that the balance is heavier on the
      side upon which depends the existence of Germany, that she may not be
      tossed in the air by Austria&rsquo;s weight. These are my views and reasons for
      the war upon which I now enter with reluctance. When the greatness and
      equilibrium of Germany are at stake, no German prince should dare
      hesitate. Austria has already cost Germany much blood, and will cause her
      to shed still more. Believe it, my nephew, and guard yourself against
      Austria&rsquo;s ambition for territorial aggrandizement. You see, I am like all
      old people, always teaching youth, while we have much to learn ourselves.
      We are all pupils, and our deeds are ever imperfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty cannot believe that of himself. The sage of Sans-Souci is
      the type, the master, and teacher of all Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; replied the king, &ldquo;the great men of antiquity recognized it as
      the acme of wisdom, that they must be mindful that &lsquo;in the midst of life
      we are in death.&rsquo; At the gay festivities and the luxurious feasts they
      were interrupted in the merry song and voluptuous dance, with the warning:
      &lsquo;Remember, O man, that thou must die!&rsquo; Let us profit by their wisdom! I
      have startled you from the banquet of life, and I doubt not that many
      singers and dancers will be enraged that I should put an end to the feasts
      of roses and the merry dance in such an abominable manner. It would be an
      evil omen in our warlike undertaking, if the rosy lips of the beauties
      should breathe curses to follow us; therefore, we must try to conciliate
      them, and leave a good souvenir in their hearts. You smile, my prince, and
      you think it vain trouble for an old fellow; that I cannot win the favor
      of the ladies under any pretension; so you must undertake for me the
      reconciliation and the hush-money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am prepared for any thing which your majesty imposes upon me; only I
      would defend myself against the interpretation which you give my smile&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which was very near the truth,&rdquo; interrupted the king. &ldquo;I have called you
      from the banquet of life, and I have interrupted the dancers, crowned with
      roses in the midst of their dance, which they would finish before you. I
      pray you, then, indemnify the enraged beauties, and let us go forth with a
      quiet conscience, that we in no respect are indebted to any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sire, it will be impossible for me to go to the field with a quiet
      conscience upon this point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to extend to you the means to do so,&rdquo; replied the king,
      graciously smiling. &ldquo;Take this little box; it contains a wonderful elixir,
      proof against all the infirmities and weaknesses of humanity, of one of
      the greatest philosophers of human nature. By the right use of it, tears
      of sorrow are changed to tears of joy, and a Megerea into a smiling angel,
      as by enchantment. Before going to the war, I pray you to prove the
      miraculous elixir upon one of the angry beauties. For, I repeat, we must
      put our house in order, and leave no debts behind us. The debts of
      gratitude must not be forgotten. Let us say &lsquo;Gesegnete Mahlzeit&rsquo; when we
      have been well feasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king handed the prince a little box, of beautiful workmanship, and
      smiled as he rather vehemently thanked him, and at the same time tried to
      open it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remark with pleasure that you have a tolerably innocent heart, as you
      betray curiosity about the wonderful elixir. I supposed men, to say
      nothing of beautiful women, had long since instructed you that it was the
      only balsam for all the evils of life. My minister Herzberg will give you
      the key of the little box, and advise you as to the right use of the
      elixir. Farewell, with the hope of soon seeing you again, my nephew. I
      start for Silesia to-morrow, as I must travel slower than you young
      people. You will follow me in a few days. Again farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Extending his meagre white hand to the prince, he withdrew it quickly, as
      the latter was about to press it to his lips, and motioned to the door
      kindly.

      CHAPTER VIII. THE GOLDEN RAIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Prince Frederick William betook himself, with painful curiosity, to the
      audience-room, where the Minister von Herzberg awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your excellency,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;his majesty refers me to you, for the true
      explanation of the miraculous elixir contained in this little box, and
      about which I am naturally very curious, and beg of you the key to open
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your royal highness,&rdquo; said the minister, smiling, &ldquo;have the grace to
      grant me a few moments&rsquo; conversation, which may serve as an explanation,
      for his majesty has not in reality given me a key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, my dear excellency, to explain it,&rdquo; cried the prince,
      impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me if I probe the tenderest feelings of your heart, my prince. The
      command of the king imposes this duty upon me. He has known for a long
      time of your connection with a certain person, to whom you are more
      devoted than to your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, rather, his majesty has twice forced me to marry two unloved and
      unknown princesses, when he knew that I already loved this certain person.
      Twice I have married, because the command of his king is law to the crown
      prince of Prussia. For my love and my sympathy there is no law but that of
      my own heart, and this alone have I followed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His majesty does not reproach you. The philosopher of Sans-Souci
      understands human nature, and he feels indulgent toward your weakness. He
      is quite satisfied that you have chosen this person, as friend and
      favorite, to console yourself for an unhappy marriage. Her low birth is a
      guaranty that she will never mingle in politics, an act which would be
      visited with his majesty&rsquo;s highest displeasure. While his majesty permits
      you to continue this intimacy, and recognizes the existence of this woman,
      he wishes her to be provided for as becomes the mistress of a crown
      prince, and not as the grisette of a gentleman. She should have her own
      house, and the livery of her lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if it were my fault that this has not already been arranged!&rdquo; cried
      the prince. &ldquo;Am I not daily and hourly tormented with poverty, and
      scarcely know how to turn, between necessary expenses and urgent
      creditors? You know well yourself, your excellency, how stingy and
      parsimonious the king is to the crown prince. He scarcely affords me the
      means to support my family in a decent, to say nothing of a princely,
      manner. How dependent we all are, myself, my wife, and my children upon
      the king, whose economy increases, while our wants and expenses also
      increase every year! It is sufficiently sad that I cannot reward those who
      have proved to me during ten years their fidelity and love, but I must
      suffer them to live in dependence and want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His majesty understands that, and thinks that as your royal highness is
      to go to the field, and will be exposed, as a brave commander, to the
      uncertain fate of battle, that you should assure the future of all those
      who are dear to you, and arrange a certain competency for them. A good
      opportunity now offers to you. Count Schmettau will sell his villa at
      Charlottenburg, and it would be agreeable to his majesty that you should
      purchase it, and assign it to those dearest to you. In order to give you
      as little trouble as possible, his majesty has had the matter already
      arranged, through his equerry, Count Schmettau, and the purchase can be
      made this very hour. Here is the bill of sale; only the name of the
      present possessor is wanting, the signature of the purchaser, and the
      payment of seven thousand five hundred thalers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The names can be quickly written; but, your excellency,&rdquo; cried the
      prince, &ldquo;where will the money come from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just given your royal highness the key to the little box: have the
      goodness to press hard upon the rosette.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince touched the spring, the cover flew back&mdash;it contained only
      a strip of paper! Upon it was written, in the king&rsquo;s own handwriting,
      &ldquo;Bill of exchange upon my treasurer. Pay to the order of the Prince of
      Prussia twenty thousand thalers.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: &ldquo;Memoirs of the Countess
      Lichtenau,&rdquo; vol.1]</i> The prince&rsquo;s face lighted up with joy. &ldquo;Oh! the
      king has indeed given me a miraculous elixir, that compensates for all
      misfortunes, heals all infirmities, and is a balsam for all possible
      griefs. I will bring it into use immediately, and sign the bill of sale.&rdquo;
       He signed the paper, and filled with haste the deficiency in the contract.
      &ldquo;It is done!&rdquo; he cried, joyfully, &ldquo;the proprietress, Wilhelmine Enke;
      purchaser, Frederick William of Prussia. Nothing remains to be done but to
      draw upon the king&rsquo;s treasury, and pay Count Schmettau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your royal highness is spared even that trouble. Here are twenty rolls,
      and each roll contains one hundred double Fredericks d&rsquo;or, and, when your
      highness commands it, I will reserve seven rolls and pay Count Schmettau;
      then there remain thirteen for yourself. Here is the contract, which you
      will give in person to the possessor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, I must go to the king,&rdquo; said the prince; &ldquo;my heart urges me to
      express my gratitude to him, and my deep sense of his goodness and
      tenderness. I feel ashamed without being humbled, like a repentant son,
      who has doubted the generosity and goodness of his father, because he has
      sometimes severely reprimanded his faults. I must go at once to the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not receive your royal highness,&rdquo; answered Herzberg, smiling.
      &ldquo;You know our sovereign, who so fully deserves our admiration and love.
      His favor and goodness beam upon us all, and he desires neither thanks nor
      acknowledgment. He performs his noble, glorious deeds in a harsh manner,
      that he may relieve the recipients of his bounty from the burden of
      gratitude; and often when he is the most morose and harsh, is he at heart
      the most gracious and affectionate. You and yours have experienced it
      to-day. He appeared to be angry, and enveloped himself in the toga of a
      severe judge of morals; but, under this toga, there beat the kind, noble
      heart of a friend and father, who punishes with rigorous words, and
      forgives with generous, benevolent deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For this I must thank him&mdash;he must listen to me!&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be angry if your royal highness forces him to receive thanks when
      he would avoid them. He has expressly commanded me to entreat you never to
      allude to the affair, and never to speak of it to others, as it would not
      be agreeable to his majesty to have the family affairs known to the world.
      You would best please his majesty by following exactly his wishes, and
      when you meet him never allude to it. As I have said, this is the express
      wish and command of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which I must naturally follow,&rdquo; sighed the prince, &ldquo;although I
      acknowledge that it is unpleasant to me to receive so much kindness from
      him without at least returning my most heart-felt thanks. Say to the king,
      that I am deeply, sensibly moved with his tender sympathy and generosity.
      And now I will hasten to Wilhelmine Enke; but, it occurs to me that it may
      not be possible; the king has made her a prisoner in her own house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not trouble yourself about that. If it is your royal highness&rsquo;s
      pleasure, drive at once to Charlottenburg. You will find the new possessor
      there and she will relate to you her interview with the mayor of Berlin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I shall drive at once to the villa. I am curious to learn what Von
      Kircheisen has told her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I imagined that you would be, and ordered your carriage here, as you
      could not well ride upon horseback with the heavy rolls of gold; and if it
      is your pleasure, I will order the footman to place the box, into which I
      have put them, in the carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; I beg you to let me carry them,&rdquo; cried the prince, seizing the
      box with both hands. &ldquo;It is truly heavy, but an agreeable burden, and if
      it lames my arm I shall bethink myself of the miraculous elixir, which
      will give me courage and strength. Farewell, your excellency; I shall
      hurry on to Charlottenburg!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince hastened to his carriage, and ordered the coachman to drive at
      full speed to the villa. Thanks to this order, he reached it in about an
      hour. No one was there to receive him upon his arrival. The hall was
      empty, and the rooms were closed. The prince passed on to the opposite
      end, where there was a door open, and stood upon a balcony, with steps
      descending into the garden, which, with its flower-beds, grass-plots,
      shrubbery, and the tall trees, formed a lovely background. The birds were
      singing, the trees rustled, and variegated butterflies fluttered over the
      odorous flowers. Upon the turf, forming a beautiful group, was Wilhelmine
      playing with her daughter, and the nurse with the little boy upon her lap,
      who laughingly stretched out his arms toward his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wilhelmine&mdash;Wilhelmine!&rdquo; cried the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cry of joy she answered, and flew toward the house. &ldquo;You have come
      at last, my beloved lord,&rdquo; she cried, almost breathless, mounting the
      steps. &ldquo;I beg you to tell me what all this means? I am dying of
      curiosity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also,&rdquo; said the prince, smiling. &ldquo;Have the goodness to lead me to one
      of the rooms, that I may set down this box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does that hobgoblin contain, that it prevents your embracing me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not ask, but hasten to assist me to relieve myself of the burden.&rdquo;
       They entered the house, and Wilhelmine opened the wide folding-doors,
      which led into a very tastefully-furnished room. Frederick William set the
      box upon the marble table, and sank upon a divan with Wilhelmine in his
      arms. &ldquo;First of all, tell me what Von Kircheisen said to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He commanded me, in the name of the king, to give up my dwelling at
      Berlin and at Potsdam, and to avoid showing myself in public at both
      places, that those who had the right to the love and fidelity of the
      Prince of Prussia should not be annoyed at the sight of me; that I should
      live retired, and leave the appointed residence as little as possible, for
      then the king would be inclined to ignore my existence, and take no
      further notice of me. But, if I attempted to play a role, his majesty
      would take good care that it should be forever played out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those were harsh, cruel words,&rdquo; sighed Frederick William.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harsh, cruel words,&rdquo; repeated Wilhelmine, sorrowfully. &ldquo;They pierced my
      soul, and I shrieked at last from agony. Herr von Kircheisen was quite
      frightened, and begged me to excuse him, that he must thus speak to me,
      but the king had commanded him to repeat his very words. The carriage was
      at the door, he said, ready to convey me to my future dwelling, for I must
      immediately leave Berlin, and the king be informed of my setting out. The
      coachman received the order, and here I am, without knowing what I am to
      do, or whether I shall remain here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Wilhelmine, you are to remain here; at last we have a home, and a
      resting-place for our love and our children. This house is yours&mdash;you
      are mistress here, and you must welcome me as your guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This house is mine!&rdquo; she cried, joyfully. &ldquo;Did you give it to me? How
      generous, and how extravagant you are! Protect me with the gift of your
      love, as if you were Jupiter and I Danae!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful picture, and, that it may be a reality, I will play the role
      of Jupiter and open the box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a roll of gold, and let it fall upon Wilhelmine&rsquo;s head, her
      beautiful shoulders, and her arms, like a shower of gold. She shrieked and
      laughed, and sought to gather up the pieces which rolled ringing around
      her upon the floor. The prince seized another roll, and another still,
      till she was flooded with the glistening pieces. Then another and another,
      until Wilhelmine, laughing, screamed for grace, and sprang up, the gold
      rolling around her like teasing goblins.

      CHAPTER IX. GERMAN LITERATURE AND THE KING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Minister Herzberg had, in the mean time, an interview with the king,
      informing him of the concluded purchase of the Schmettau villa, and of the
      emotion and gratitude of the crown prince at his royal munificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That affair is arranged, then,&rdquo; said Frederick. &ldquo;If Fate wills that the
      prince should not return from this campaign, then this certain person and
      the two poor worms are provided for, who are destined to wander through
      the world nameless and fatherless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us hope that fate will not deal so harshly with the prince, or bring
      such sorrow upon your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, Fate is a hard-hearted creature, the tears of mankind are of
      no more importance to her than the raindrops falling from the roof. She
      strides with gigantic power over men, crushing them all in dust&mdash;the
      great as well as the little&mdash;the king as well as the beggar. For my
      part I yield to Fate without a murmur. Politicians and warriors are mere
      puppets in the hands of Providence. We act without knowing why, for we are
      unknowingly the tools of an invisible hand. Often the result of our
      actions is the reverse of our hopes! Let all things take their course, as
      it best pleases God, and let us not think to master Fate. <i>[Footnote:
      The king&rsquo;s words.&mdash;&ldquo;Posthumous Works,&rdquo; vol. x., p. 256.]</i> That is
      my creed, Herzberg, and if I do not return from this infamous campaign,
      you will know that I have yielded to Fate without murmuring. You
      understand my wishes in all things; the current affairs of government
      should go on regularly. If any thing extraordinary occurs, let me be
      informed at once. Is there any news, Herzberg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing worth recounting, sire, except that the young Duke of Weimar is
      in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it; he has announced himself. I cannot speak with him. I have
      asked my brother Henry to arrange the conditions under which he will allow
      us to enlist men for my army in his duchy. I hope he will be reasonable,
      and not prevent it. That is no news that the Duke of Weimar has arrived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only the duke has arrived, but he has brought his dear friend with
      him whom the people in Saxe-Weimar say makes the good and bad weather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the weather-maker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, this weather-maker is the author of &lsquo;The Sorrows of Young
      Werther,&rsquo; Johann Wolfgang Goethe, who for four years has aroused the
      hearts and excited the imaginations of all Germany. If I am not deceived,
      a great future opens for this poet, and he will be a star of the first
      magnitude in the sky of German literature. I believe it would be well
      worth the trouble for your majesty to see him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not trouble me with your German literature, and your stars of the
      first magnitude! We must acknowledge our poverty with humility;
      belles-lettres have never achieved success upon our soil. Moreover, this
      star of the first magnitude&mdash;this Herr Goethe&mdash;I remember him
      well; I wish to know nothing of him. He has quite turned the heads of all
      the love-sick fools with his &lsquo;Sorrows of Young Werther.&rsquo; You cannot count
      that a merit. The youth of Germany were sufficiently enamoured, without
      the love-whining romances of Herr Goethe to pour oil on the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sire, that I should presume to differ from you; but this book
      which your majesty condemns has not only produced a furor in Germany, but
      throughout Europe&mdash;throughout the world even. That which public
      opinion sustains in such a marked manner cannot be wholly unworthy. &lsquo;Vox
      populi, vox dei,&rsquo; is a true maxim in all ages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not true!&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;The old Roman maxim is not applicable
      to our effeminate, degraded people. Nowadays, whoever flatters the people
      and glorifies their weaknesses, is a good fellow, and he is extolled to
      the skies. Public opinion calls him a genius and a Messiah. Away with your
      nonsense! The &lsquo;Werther&rsquo; of Herr Goethe has wrought no good; it has made
      the healthy sick, and has not restored invalids to health. Since its
      appearance a mad love-fever has seized all the young people, and silly
      sentimentalities and flirtations have become the fashion. These modern
      Werthers behave as if love were a tarantula, with the bite of which they
      must become mad, to be considered model young men. They groan and sigh,
      take moonlight walks, but they have no courage in their souls, and will
      never make good soldiers. This is the fault of Herr Werther, and his
      abominable lamentations. It is a miserable work, and not worth the trouble
      of talking about, for no earnest man will read it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sire; your majesty has graciously permitted me to enter the
      lists as knight and champion of German literature, and sometimes to defend
      the German Muse, who stands unnoticed and unknown under the shadow of your
      throne; while the French lady, with her brilliant attire and painted
      cheeks, is always welcomed. I beg your majesty to believe that, although
      this romance may have done some harm, it has, on the other hand, done
      infinite service. A great and immortal merit cannot be denied to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What merit?&rdquo; demanded the king, slowly taking a pinch of snuff; &ldquo;I am
      very curious to know what merit that crazy, love-sick book has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it has the great merit to have enriched the German literature with
      a work whose masterly language alone raises it above every thing
      heretofore produced by a German author. It has emancipated our country&rsquo;s
      literature from its clumsy, awkward childhood, and presented it as an
      ardent, inspired youth, ready for combat, upon the lips of whom the gods
      have placed the right word to express every feeling and every thought&mdash;a
      youth who is capable of probing the depths of the human heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish all this might have remained in the depths,&rdquo; cried Frederick,
      annoyed. &ldquo;You have defended the German Muse before; but you remember that
      I am incorrigible. You cannot persuade me that bungling is master-work. It
      is not the poverty of the mind, but the fault of the language, which is
      not capable of expressing with brevity and precision. For how could any
      one translate Tacitus into German without adding a mass of words and
      phrases? In French it is not necessary; one can express himself with
      brevity, and to the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I shall permit myself to prove to you that the brevity of Tacitus
      can be imitated in the German language. I will translate a part of
      Tacitus, to give your majesty a proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take you at your word! And I will answer you in a treatise upon
      German literature, its short-comings, and the means for its improvement.
      <i>[Footnote: This treatise appeared during the Bavarian war of
      succession, in the winter of 1779] Until then, a truce. I insist upon it&mdash;good
      German authors are entirely wanting to us Germans. They may appear a long
      time after I have joined Voltaire and Algarotti in the Elysian
      Fields.&rdquo;[Footnote: The king&rsquo;s words.&mdash;See &ldquo;Posthumous Works,&rdquo; vol.
      II., p. 293.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are already here,&rdquo; cried Herzberg, zealously. &ldquo;We have, for example,
      Lessing, who has written two dramas, of which every nation might be proud&mdash;&lsquo;Minna
      von Barnhelm, and Emilia Calotti.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing of them,&rdquo; said the king, with indifference. &ldquo;I have never
      heard of your Lessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, this wonderful comedy, &lsquo;Minna von Barnhelm,&rsquo; was written
      for your majesty&rsquo;s glorification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more the reason why I should not read it! A German comedy! That must
      be fine stuff for the German theatre, the most miserable of all. In
      Germany, Melpomene has untutored admirers, some walking on stilts, others
      crawling in the mire, from the altars of the goddess. The Germans will
      ever be repulsed, as they are rebels to her laws, and understand not the
      art to move and interest the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sire, you have never deigned to become acquainted with &lsquo;Minna von
      Barnhelm&rsquo; nor &lsquo;Emilia Calotti.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, Herzberg, do not be so furious; you are a lover of German
      literature, and some allowance must be made for those who are in love. You
      will not persuade me to read your things which you call German comedies
      and tragedies. I will take good care; my teeth are not strong enough to
      grind such hard bits. Now do not be angry, Herzberg. The first leisure
      hours that I have in this campaign I shall employ on my treatise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the first leisure hours that I have,&rdquo; growled the minister, &ldquo;I shall
      employ to translate a portion of Tacitus into our beautiful German
      language, to send to your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are incorrigible,&rdquo; said Frederick, smiling. &ldquo;We shall see, and until
      then let us keep the peace, Herzberg. When one is about to go to war, it
      is well to be at peace with one&rsquo;s conscience and with his friends; so let
      us be good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, your graciousness and kindness make me truly ashamed,&rdquo; said
      the minister, feelingly. &ldquo;I beg pardon a thousand times, if I have allowed
      myself to be carried away with unbecoming violence in my zeal for our poor
      neglected German literature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I approve of your zeal, and it pleases me that you are a faithful knight,
      sans peur et sans reproche. I do not ascribe its poverty to the German
      nation, who have as much spirit and genius as any nation, the mental
      development of which has been retarded by outward circumstances, which
      prevented her rising to an equality with her neighbors. We shall one day
      have classical writers, and every one will read them to cultivate himself.
      Our neighbors will learn German, and it will be spoken with pleasure at
      courts; and it can well happen that our language, when perfectly formed,
      will spread throughout Europe. We shall have our German classics also.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote:
      The king&rsquo;s words&mdash;see &ldquo;Posthumous Works,&rdquo; vol. III.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled, well pleased, as he observed by stolen glances the noble,
      intelligent face of Herzberg brighten, and the gloomy clouds dispersed
      which had overshadowed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, is it not true that you are again contented?&rdquo; said the king,
      graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted with the prophecy for the German language, your majesty;
      and may I add something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will weigh on your heart if you do not tell it,&rdquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prophesy that this Goethe will one day belong to the classic authors,
      and therefore I would beg once more of your majesty to grant him a
      gracious look, and invite him to your presence. If you find no pleasure in
      &lsquo;The Sorrows of Werther,&rsquo; Goethe has created other beautiful works. He is
      the author of the tragedy of &lsquo;Stella.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sentimental, immoral piece, which we forbid the representation of in
      Berlin, because it portrays a fellow who made love to two women at once,
      playing the double role of lover to his wife and his paramour, while he
      had a grown-up daughter! It is an immoral piece, which excites the
      tear-glands, and ends as &lsquo;Werther,&rsquo; by the hero blowing his brains out. It
      is directed against all morals, and against marriage; therefore it was
      forbidden.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: The tragedy of &ldquo;Stella&rdquo; was represented in
      Berlin with great applause, and denounced by the king as immoral, in the
      year 1776, and the further representation forbidden.&mdash;See Plumke,
      &ldquo;History of the Berlin Theatres.&rdquo;]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sire, Herr Goethe has not only written &lsquo;Stella,&rsquo; but &lsquo;Clavigo&rsquo; also,
      which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which he has copied exactly from the &lsquo;Memoires de Beaumarchais,&rsquo;&rdquo;
       interrupted the king. &ldquo;That is not a German, but a French production.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to cite a genuine German production, which Johann Wolfgang
      Goethe has written. I mean the drama &lsquo;Gotz von Berlichingen.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&mdash;it is sufficient. I do not wish to hear any thing more,&rdquo;
       cried the king, indignant, and rising. &ldquo;It is bad enough that such pieces
      should appear upon the German stage as this &lsquo;Gotz von Berlichingen.&rsquo; They
      are nothing less than abominable imitations of the bad English pieces of
      Shakespeare! The pit applauds them, and demands with enthusiasm these very
      disgusting platitudes. <i>[Footnote: The king&rsquo;s own words.&mdash;See
      &ldquo;Posthumous Works,&rdquo; vol. iii.]</i> Do not be angry again, you must have
      patience with the old boy! I shall rejoice heartily if this Herr Goethe
      becomes a classic writer one day, as you say. I shall not live to witness
      it. I only see the embryo where you see the full-grown author. We will
      talk further about it when we meet in the Elysian Fields; then we will
      see, when you present this Herr Johann Wolfgang Goethe, as a German
      classic writer, to Homer, Horace, Virgil, and Corneille, if they do not
      turn their backs upon him. Now adieu, Herzberg! So soon as circumstances
      permit, I shall send for you to go to Silesia, and then you can give me
      your German translation of Tacitus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king nodded in a friendly manner to his minister, and slowly walked
      back and forth, while he took leave and withdrew. After a few moments he
      rang, and the summons was immediately answered by the footman Schultz.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king fixed upon him one of those searching glances of his fiery eyes
      which confounded and confused the footman. He remained standing and
      embarrassed, with downcast look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you standing there for?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;Did I not ring for
      you, and do you not know what you have to do?&rdquo; Frederick continued to
      regard him, with flashing eyes, which increased the lackey&rsquo;s confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He forgot entirely that the summons was for his majesty&rsquo;s lunch, and all
      that he had to do was to open the door to the adjoining room, where it
      stood already prepared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederick waited a moment, but the footman still stood irresolute, when
      his majesty indicated to him to approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached, staggering under the puzzling glance of his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I see what it is,&rdquo; said Frederick, shrugging his shoulders; &ldquo;you are
      drunk again, as you often are, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; cried Schultz, amazed, &ldquo;I drunk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&mdash;will you be bold enough to reason with me? I say that you
      are drunk, and I want no drunken footmen. They must be well-behaved, sober
      fellows, who keep their ears open and their mouths shut&mdash;who are
      neither drunkards nor gossips, and do not take for truth what they have
      experienced in their drunken fits. I do not want such fellows as you are
      at all; you are only fit food for cannon, and for that you shall serve. Go
      to General Alvensleben, and present yourself to enter the guards. You are
      lucky to go to the field at once; to-morrow you will set off. Say to the
      general that I sent you, and that you are to enter as a common soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, your majesty, I do not know what I have done,&rdquo; cried Schultz,
      whiningly. &ldquo;I really am not drunk. I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; thundered the king. &ldquo;Do as I command you! Go to General
      Alvensleben, and present yourself to enter the guards at once. Away with
      you! I do not need drunken, gossiping footmen in my service. Away with
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footman slunk slowly away, his head hanging down, with difficulty
      restraining the tears which stood in large drops in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king followed him with his glance, which softened and grew gentler
      from sympathy. &ldquo;I pity him, the poor fellow! but I must teach him a
      lesson. I want no gossips around me. He need only wear the uniform two
      weeks or so, that will bring him to reason. Then I will pardon him, and
      receive him into my service again. He is a good-natured fellow, and would
      not betray any one as Kretzschmar betrayed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king stepped to the window to look at the gentleman who was eagerly
      engaged in conversation with the castellan of Sans-Souci. At this instant
      the footman entered with a sealed note for the king. &ldquo;From his royal
      highness Prince Henry,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who brought it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The gentleman who speaks with the castellan upon the terrace. I wait your
      majesty&rsquo;s commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, then.&rdquo; The note ran thus: &ldquo;Your majesty, my dearly-beloved brother:
      The bearer, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, one of the literati, and a poet, and
      at this time secretary of legation to the duchy of Saxe-Weimar, is a great
      favorite of the duke&rsquo;s, our nephew. I met him returning from the parade in
      company with the duke, who expressed to me the strong desire his secretary
      had to visit the celebrated house of the great philosopher of Sans-Souci,
      and see the room once occupied by Voltaire. I could not well refuse, and
      therefore address these few lines to your majesty before returning to
      Berlin with the duke, who will dine with me, accompanied by his secretary.
      I am your majesty&rsquo;s most humble servant and brother, HENRY.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell the castellan that I grant him permission to show the house and park
      to the stranger; he shall take care not to come in my way, so that I shall
      be obliged to meet him. Tell this aside, that you may not be overheard.
      Hasten, for they have already been waiting some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king walked again to the window, and, hidden by the curtain, peeped
      out. &ldquo;So, this is Herr Goethe, is it? What assurance! There he stands,
      sketching the house. What wonderful eyes the man has! With what a proud,
      confident manner he looks around! What a brow! Truly he is a handsome
      fellow, and Herzberg may be right after all. That brow betokens thought,
      and from those eyes there flashes a divine light. But he looks overbearing
      and proud. Now, I am doubly pleased that I refused Herzberg to have any
      thing to do with him. Such presumptive geniuses must be rather kept back;
      then they feel their power, and strive to bring themselves forward. Yes! I
      believe that man has a future. He looks like the youthful god Apollo, who
      may have condescended to descend to earth! He shall not entrap me with his
      beautiful head. If he is the man who makes good and bad weather in Weimar,
      he shall learn that rain and sunshine at Sans-Souci do not depend upon
      him; that the sun and clouds here do not care whether Herr Goethe is in
      the world or not. For sunshine and storm we depend upon the Great
      Weather-Maker, to whom we must all bow; evil and good days in Prussia
      shall emanate from me, so long as I live. Sometimes I succeed in causing a
      little sunshine,&rdquo; continued the king. &ldquo;I believe the Prince of Prussia has
      to-day felt the happy influence of the sun&rsquo;s rays; and while it is dull
      and lonely at Sans-Souei, may it be brighter and more cheerful at
      Charlottenburg! Eh bien! old boy,&rdquo; said the king, stopping, &ldquo;you are
      playing the sentimental, and eulogizing your loneliness. Well, well, do
      not complain.&mdash;Oh, come to me, spirits of my friends, and hold
      converse with me! Voltaire, D&rsquo;Argens, and my beloved Lord-Marshal Keith!
      Come to me, departed souls, with the memories of happier days, and hover
      with thy cheering, sunny influence over the wrinkled brow of old Fritz!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the lonely king implored the spirits of his friends, to brighten
      with their presence the quiet, gloomy apartment at Sans-Souci, the sun
      shone in full splendor at Charlottenburg&mdash;the sunshine beaming from
      the munificence of Frederick. Wilhelmine Enke had passed the whole day in
      admiring the beautiful and tasteful arrangement of the villa. Every piece
      of furniture, every ornament, she examined attentively&mdash;all filled
      her with delight. The prince, who accompanied her from room to room,
      listened to her outbursts of pleasure, rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish that I could often prepare such happiness for you, dearest, for my
      heart is twice gladdened to see your beaming face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reflected from your own. You are my good genius upon earth. You have
      caused the poor, neglected child to become the rich and happy woman. To
      you I owe this home, this foot of earth, which I can call my own. Here
      blossom the flowers for me&mdash;here I am mistress, and those who enter
      must come as my guests, and honor me. All this I owe to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to me,&rdquo; said the prince, smiling; &ldquo;I only gave to you what was given
      to me! To the king belong your thanks. Harsh in words, but gentle in
      deeds, he has given you this refuge, freeing you from the slavery of
      poverty, from the sorrow of being homeless. But tell it not, Wilhelmine.
      The king would be angry if it were known that he not only tolerated but
      showed great generosity to you. It is a secret that I ought not even to
      disclose to you. I could not receive your thanks, for I have not deserved
      them. From the king comes your good fortune, not from me. The day will
      come when I can requite you, when the poor crown prince becomes the rich
      king. On that day the golden rain shall again shower upon you, never to
      cease, and, vying with the shower of gold, the brightest sunbeams play
      continually around you. As king, I will reward your fidelity and love,
      which you have proved to the poor crown prince, with splendor, power, and
      riches. Until then rejoice with the little that his grace has accorded
      you, and await the much that love will one day bring you. Farewell,
      Wilhelmine, the evening sets in, and I must forth to Potsdam. The king
      would never pardon me if I did not pass the last evening with my wife in
      the circle of my family. Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He embraced her tenderly, and Wilhelmine accompanied the prince to the
      carriage, and returned to survey anew the beautiful rooms which were now
      her own possession. An unspeakable, unknown feeling was roused in her, and
      voices, which she had never heard, spoke to her from the depths of her
      heart. &ldquo;You are no longer a despised, homeless creature,&rdquo; they whispered.
      &ldquo;You have a home, a foot of earth to call your own. Make yourself a name,
      that you may be of consequence in the world. You are clever and beautiful,
      and with your prudence and beauty you can win a glorious future! Remember
      the Marquise de Pompadour, neglected and scorned as you, until a king
      loved her, and she became the wife of a king, and all France bowed down to
      her. Even the Empress Maria Theresa honored her with her notice, and
      called her cousin. I am also the favorite of a future king, and I will
      also become the queen of my king!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine had remained standing in the midst of the great drawing-room,
      which she was passing through, listening to these seductive voices, to
      these strange pictures of the future. In her imagination she saw herself
      in this room surrounded with splendor and magnificence, and sparkling with
      gems. She saw around her elegantly-attired ladies and gentlemen, in
      brilliant uniforms, glittering with orders; saw every-where smiling faces,
      and respectful manners. She saw all eyes turned to her, and heard only
      flattering words, which resounded for her from every lip&mdash;for her,
      once so despised and scorned! &ldquo;It shall be, yes, it shall be,&rdquo; cried she
      aloud. &ldquo;I will be the queen of my king! I will become the Prussian
      Marquise de Pompadour; that I swear by the heads of my children, by&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather swear by thy own beautiful head, Wilhelmine,&rdquo; said a voice behind
      her. Startled, she turned, and beheld the tall figure of a man, wrapped in
      a long cloak, who stood in the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she cried, amazed. &ldquo;How dare you enter here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The figure closed the door, without answering, and, slowly approaching
      Wilhelmine, fixed his black eyes upon her with a searching gaze. She tried
      to summon help, but the words died on her lips; her cheeks blanched with
      terror, and, as if rooted to the floor, she stood with outstretched arms
      imploring the approaching form. The figure smiled, but there was something
      commanding in its manner, and in the fiery eyes, which rested upon her.
      When quite near her, it raised its right hand with an impatient movement.
      Immediately her arms fell at her side, her cheeks glowed, and a bright
      smile lighted up her face. Then it lifted the three-cornered,
      gold-bordered hat which shaded its face, nodding to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you recognize me, Wilhelmine?&rdquo; he asked, in a sweet, melodious voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, her eyes still fixed upon him. &ldquo;You are Cagliostro,
      the great ruler and magician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did we meet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember; it was in Paris, at the house of the governor of the Bastile,
      M. Delaunay. You caused me to read in a glass the future&mdash;a bright,
      glorious future. I was surrounded with splendor and magnificence. I saw
      myself glittering with gems; a king knelt at my feet. I was encircled by
      richly-attired courtiers, who bowed before me, and honored me, whispering:
      &lsquo;We salute you, O beautiful countess; be gracious to us, exalted
      princess!&rsquo; It sounded like heavenly music, and I shouted with delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo; said Cagliostro, solemnly, &ldquo;that the crystal showed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shuddering, she murmured: &ldquo;The splendor, glory, and power vanished, and
      all was changed to a fearful picture. I saw myself in a plain, dark dress,
      in a deserted, lonely room, with iron-barred windows, and a small iron
      door closed in the dreary white walls&mdash;it was a prison! And I heard
      whispered around me: &lsquo;Woe to you, fallen and dethroned one! You have
      wasted away the days of your splendor, submit in patience to the days of
      your shame and humiliation.&rsquo; I could not endure to behold it, and screamed
      with terror, fainting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You demanded to see the future, and I showed it to you,&rdquo; said Cagliostro,
      earnestly. &ldquo;Though I let the light shine into your soul, still it was dark
      within; you pursued the way of unbelief, and desired not to walk in the
      way of knowledge. I sent messengers twice to you to lead you in the right
      path, and you sent them laughing away. Recall what I told you in Paris. I
      will it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember, master; you said that in the most important days of my life
      you would come to me, and extend to me a helping hand: if I seized it, the
      first picture would be fulfilled; if I refused it, the prison awaited me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have kept my word: to-day is an eventful day in your life; you have
      risen from want and degradation&mdash;you have mounted the first rounds of
      the ladder of your greatness and power. You are the mistress of this
      house.&rdquo; &ldquo;How did you know it?&rdquo; asked Wilhelmine, astonished. With a
      pitying smile he answered: &ldquo;I know every thing that I will, and I see many
      things that I would willingly close my eyes upon. I see your future, and
      my soul pities you, unhappy one; you are lost if you do not seize the hand
      extended to you. You see not the abyss which opens before you, and you
      will fall bleeding and with broken limbs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mercy, mercy!&rdquo; she groaned&mdash;&ldquo;stretch out your hand and protect me.&rdquo;
       Wilhelmine sank as if crushed to the earth. Cagliostro bent over her, and
      stroked her cold, pale face, breathing upon her the hot breath of his
      lips. &ldquo;I will pity you&mdash;I will protect you. Rise, my daughter!&rdquo; He
      assisted her to rise, and imprinted a passionate kiss upon her hand. &ldquo;From
      this hour I count you as one of mine,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you shall be received
      into the holy band of spirits! You shall be consecrated, and enter the
      Inner Temple. Are you prepared?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am, master,&rdquo; she humbly replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow the Temple brothers will open the temple of bliss to you. You
      shall hear, see, and be silent.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will see, hear, and be silent,&rdquo; she
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When evening sets in, send away your servants,&rdquo; commanded Cagliostro.
      &ldquo;Let the doors stand open; they shall be guarded, that no one may enter
      but the summoned. Art thou prepared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, master!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Withdraw now to your room, Wilhelmine, and elevate your thoughts in
      devotion and contrition, and await the future. Kneel, my daughter, kneel!&rdquo;
       She sank upon her knees. &ldquo;Bless me, master, bless me!&rdquo; &ldquo;I bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt a hot, burning sensation upon her forehead, and suddenly a bright
      light shone in the obscure room. Wilhelmine screamed, and covered her
      eyes. When she ventured to look up, only soft moonlight penetrated from
      the high window into the apartment, and she was alone. &ldquo;To-morrow&mdash;to-morrow,
      at midnight!&rdquo; she murmured, shuddering, and casting a timid look around.

      CHAPTER X. GOETHE IN BERLIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I only knew whether it were a man, or whether the god Apollo has
      really appeared to me in human form,&rdquo; sighed Conrector Moritz, as he paced
      his room&mdash;a strange, gloomy apartment, quite in keeping with the
      singular occupant&mdash;gray walls, with Greek apothegms inscribed upon
      them in large letters&mdash;dirty windows, pasted over with strips of
      paper; high, open book-shelves, containing several hundred books, some
      neatly arranged, others thrown together in confusion. In the midst of a
      chaos of books and papers stood a colossal bust of the Apollo-Belvedere
      upon a table near the window, the whiteness and beauty of which were in
      singular contrast, to the dust and disorder which surrounded it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the back of the room was an open wardrobe, filled with gay-colored
      garments. A beautiful carpet of brilliant colors covered the middle of the
      dirty floor, and upon this paced to and fro the strange occupant of this
      strange room, Philip Charles Moritz, conrector of the college attached to
      the Gray Monastery. There was no trace of the bearing and demeanor which
      distinguished him at the parade at Potsdam yesterday&mdash;no trace of the
      young elegant, dressed in the latest fashion. To-day he wore a white
      garment, of no particular style, tied at the neck with a red ribbon (full
      sleeves, buttoned at the wrist with lace-cuffs); and, falling from the
      shoulders in scanty folds to just below the knees, it displayed his bare
      legs, and his feet shod with red sandals.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hair was unpowdered, and not tied in a cue, according to the fashion,
      but hung in its natural brown color, flowing quite loosely, merely
      confined by a red ribbon wound in among his curls, and hanging down in
      short bows at each temple like the frontlet of the old Romans. Thus, in
      this singular costume, belonging half to old Adam, and half to the old
      Romans, Philip Moritz walked back and forth upon the carpet, ruminating
      upon the beaming beauty of the stranger whose acquaintance he had so
      recently made, and whom he could not banish from his thoughts. &ldquo;What
      wicked demon induced me to go to Potsdam yesterday?&rdquo; said he to himself.
      &ldquo;I who hate mankind, and believe that they are all of vulgar, ordinary
      material, yield to the longing for society, and am driven again into the
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A loud knocking at the door interrupted this soliloquy, and the door
      opened at the commanding &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is he, it is Apollo,&rdquo; cried Moritz, joyfully. &ldquo;Come in, sir, come in&mdash;I
      have awaited you with the most ardent desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moritz rushed to the young gentleman, who had just closed the door, and
      whose beautiful, proud face lighted up with a smile at the singular
      apparition before him. &ldquo;Pardon me, I disturb you, sir; you were about to
      make your toilet. Permit me to return after you have dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; cried Moritz, eagerly. &ldquo;You find me in my usual
      home-dress&mdash;I like my ease and freedom, and I am of opinion that
      mankind will never be happy and contented until they return to their
      natural state, wearing no more clothing, but glorying in the beauty which
      bountiful Nature has bestowed upon her most loved and chosen subjects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried the other, laughing, &ldquo;then benevolent Nature should adapt her
      climate accordingly, and relieve her dear creatures from the inclination
      to take cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; said Moritz, earnestly, &ldquo;but we will not quarrel about
      it. Will you not keep your promise to reveal to me your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me your own once more. Tell me if this youth, whom I see before me
      in this ideal dress, is the same modest young man whom I met at the parade
      yesterday, and who presented himself as Philip Moritz? Then please to
      inform me whether you are the Philip Moritz who wrote a spirited and
      cordial letter to Johann Wolfgang Goethe some years since about the
      tragedy of &lsquo;Stella,&rsquo; the representation of which had been forbidden at
      that time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am the same Philip Moritz, who wrote to the poet Goethe to prove
      to him, with the most heart-felt sympathy, that we are not all such stupid
      fellows in Berlin as Nicolai, who pronounced the tragedy &lsquo;Stella&rsquo; immoral;
      that it is only, as Goethe himself called it, &lsquo;a play for lovers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you not be kind enough to tell me what response the poet made to
      your amiable letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proud and amiable at the same time, most gracefully he answered me, but
      not with words. He sent me his tragedy &lsquo;Stella&rsquo; bound in rose-colored
      satin. <i>[Footnote: &ldquo;Goethe in Berlin,&rdquo;&mdash;Sketches from his life at
      the anniversary of his one hundredth birthday.]</i> See there! it is
      before the bust of Apollo on my writing-table, where it has lain for three
      years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he write to you at the same time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;why should he? Was not the book sufficient answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he write nothing? Permit me to say to you that Goethe behaved like a
      brute and an ass to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Moritz, angrily, &ldquo;I forbid you to speak of my favorite in so
      unbecoming a manner in my room!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;you dare not forbid me. I insist upon it that
      that man is sometimes a brute and an ass! I can penitently acknowledge it
      to you, dear Moritz, for I am Johann Wolfgang Goethe himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, you are Goethe!&rdquo; shouted Moritz, as he seized him with both hands,
      drawing him toward the window, and gazing at him with the greatest
      enthusiasm and delight. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;you are either Apollo or
      Goethe! The gods are not so stupid as to return to this miserable world,
      so you must be Goethe. No other man would dare to sport such a godlike
      face as you do, you favorite of the gods!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He then loosed his hold upon the smiling poet, and sprang to the
      writing-table. &ldquo;Listen, Apollo,&rdquo; he cried, with wild joy. &ldquo;Goethe is here,
      thy dear son is here! Hurrah! long live Goethe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took the rose-colored little book, and shouting tossed it to the
      ceiling, and sprang about like a mad bacchant, and finally threw himself
      upon the carpet, rolling over and over like a frolicksome, good-natured
      child upon its nurse&rsquo;s lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goethe laughed aloud. &ldquo;What are you doing, dear Moritz? What does this
      mean?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moritz stopped a moment, looking up to Goethe with a face beaming with
      joy. &ldquo;I cannot better express my happiness. Language is too feeble&mdash;too
      poor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If that is the case, then I will join you,&rdquo; said Goethe, throwing himself
      upon the carpet, rolling and tumbling about. <i>[Footnote: This scene
      which I relate, and which Teichman also mentions in his &ldquo;Leaves of Memory
      of Goethe in Berlin,&rdquo; has been often related to me by Ludwig Tieck exactly
      in this manner. Teichman believes it was the poet Burman. But I remember
      distinctly that Ludwig Tieck told me that it was the eccentric savant,
      Philip Moritz, with whom Goethe made the acquaintance in this original
      manner.&mdash;The Authoress.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once Moritz jumped up without saying a word, rushed to the
      wardrobe, dressed himself in modest attire in a few moments, and presented
      himself to Goethe, who rose from the carpet quite astounded at the sudden
      metamorphosis. Then he seized his three-cornered hat to go out, when
      Goethe held him fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going into the street, sir! You forget that your hair is
      flying about as if unloosed by a divine madness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, people are quite accustomed to see me in a strange costume, and the
      most of them think me crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are aware that insane people believe that they only are sane, and
      that reasonable people are insane. You will grant me that it is much more
      like a crazy person to strew his hair with flour, and tie it up in that
      ridiculous cue, than to wear it as God made it, uncombed and unparted, as
      I do my beautiful hair, and for which they call me crazy! But, for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake, where are you going?&rdquo; asked Goethe, struggling to retain
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to trumpet through every street in Berlin that the author of
      &lsquo;Werther,&rsquo; of &lsquo;Clavigo,&rsquo; of &lsquo;Gotz von Berlichingen,&rsquo; of &lsquo;Stella,&rsquo; of the
      most beautiful poems, is in my humble apartment. I will call in all the
      little poets and savants of Berlin; I will drag Mammler, Nicolai, Engel,
      Spaulding, Gedicke, Plumicke, Karschin, and Burman here. They shall all
      come to see Wolfgang Goethe, and adore him. The insignificant poets shall
      pay homage to thee, the true poet, the favorite of Apollo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Moritz, if you leave me for that, I will run away, and you will
      trouble yourself in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impossible; you will be my prisoner until I return. I shall lock you in,
      and you cannot escape by the window, as I fortunately live on the third
      story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall not wait to be looked in,&rdquo; answered Goethe, slightly annoyed.
      &ldquo;I came to see you, and if you run away I shall go also, and I advise you
      not to try to prevent me.&rdquo; His voice resounded through the apartment,
      growing louder as he spoke, his cheeks flushed, and his high, commanding
      brow contracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jupiter Tonans!&rdquo; cried Moritz, regarding him, &ldquo;you are truly Jupiter
      Tonans in person, and I bow before you and obey your command. I shall
      remain to worship you, and gaze at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it may be possible to speak in a reasonable manner to me,&rdquo; said
      Goethe, coaxingly. &ldquo;Away with sentimentality and odors of incense! We are
      no sybarites, to feed on sweet-meats and cakes; but we are men who have a
      noble aim in view, attained only by a thorny path. Our eyes must remain
      fixed upon the goal, and nothing must divert them from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the aim that we should strive for?&rdquo; asked Moritz, his whole being
      suddenly changing, and his manner expressing the greatest depression and
      sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goethe smiled. &ldquo;How can you ask, as if you did not know it yourself.
      Self-knowledge should be our first aim! The ancient philosophers were wise
      to have inscribed over the entrances to their temples, &lsquo;Know thyself,&rsquo; in
      order to remind all approaching, to examine themselves before they entered
      the halls of the gods. Is not the human heart equally a temple? only the
      demons and the gods strive together therein, unfortunately. To drive the
      former out, and give place to the latter, should be our aim; and when once
      purified, and room is given for good deeds and great achievements, we
      shall not rest satisfied simply to conquer, but rise with gladness to
      build altars upon those places which we have freed from the demons; for
      that, we must steadily keep in view truth and reality, and not hide them
      with a black veil, or array them in party-colored rags. Our ideas must be
      clear about the consequences of things, that we may not be like those
      foolish men who drink wine every evening and complain of headache every
      morning, resorting to preventives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did Goethe know the struggles and dissensions which rent the heart of the
      young man to whom he spoke? Had his searching eyes read the secrets which
      were hidden in that darkened soul? He regarded him as he spoke with so
      much commiseration that Moritz&rsquo;s heart softened under the genial influence
      of sympathy and kindness. A convulsive trembling seized him, his cheeks
      were burning red, and his features expressed the struggle within. Suddenly
      he burst into tears. &ldquo;I am very, very wretched,&rdquo; he sighed, with a voice
      suffocated by weeping, and sank upon a chair, sobbing aloud, and covering
      his face with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goethe approached him, and laid his hand gently upon his shoulder. &ldquo;Why
      are you so miserable? Is there any human being who can help you?&rdquo; he
      kindly inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sobbed Moritz; &ldquo;there are those who could, but they will not, and I
      am lost. I stand upon the brink of a precipice, with Insanity staring at
      me, grinning and showing her teeth. I know it, but cannot retreat. I wear
      the mask of madness to conceal my careworn face. Your divine eyes could
      not be deceived. You have not mistaken the caricature for the true face.
      You have penetrated beneath the gay tatters, and have seen the misery
      which sought to hide itself there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw it, and I bewailed it, as a friend pities a friend whom he would
      willingly aid if he only knew how to do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one can help me,&rdquo; sighed Moritz, shaking his head mournfully. &ldquo;I am
      lost, irremediably lost!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one is lost who will save himself. He who is wrecked by a storm and
      tossed upon the raging sea, ought to be upon the watch for a plank by
      which he can save himself. He must keep his eyes open, and not let his
      arms hang idly; for if he allows himself to be swallowed up he becomes a
      self-murderer, who, like Erostratus, destroyed the holy temple, and gained
      eternal fame through eternal shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you saying?&rdquo; cried Moritz, &ldquo;you, the author of &lsquo;Werther,&rsquo; of
      that immortal work which has drunk the tears of the whole world, and has
      become the Holy Testament for unhappy souls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather say for lovers,&rdquo; replied Goethe, &ldquo;and add also those troubled
      spirits who think themselves poetical when they whine and howl; who cry
      over misfortune if Fate denies them the toy which their vanity, their
      ambition, or their amorousness, had chosen. Do not burden me with what I
      am not guilty of; do not say that wine is a poison, because it is not good
      for the sick. It is intended for well people; it animates and inspires
      them to fresh vigor. Now please to consider yourself well, and not ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am ill, indeed I am ill,&rdquo; sighed Moritz. &ldquo;Oh! continue to regard me
      with those eyes, which shine like stars into my benighted soul. I feel
      like one who has long wandered through the desert, his feet burnt with the
      sand, his hair scorched with the sun, and, exhausted with hunger and
      thirst, feels death approaching. Suddenly he discovers a green oasis, and
      a being with outstretched arms calling to him with a soft, angel-like
      voice: &lsquo;Come, save thyself in my arms; feel that thou art not alone in the
      desert, for I am with thee, and will sustain thee!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I say it to you from the bottom of my heart,&rdquo; said Goethe,
      affectionately. &ldquo;Yes, here is one, who is only too happy to aid you, who
      can sympathize with every sorrow, because he has himself felt it in his
      own breast, who may even say of himself, like Ovid: &lsquo;Nothing human is
      strange to me.&rsquo; If I can aid you, say so, and I will willingly do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you cannot,&rdquo; murmured Moritz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least confide your grief to me; that is an alleviation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how kind and generous you are!&rdquo; Moritz said, pressing the hand of his
      new-made friend to his bosom. &ldquo;How much good it does me to listen to you,
      and look at your beautiful face! I believed myself steeled against every
      thing that could happen to mortals; that the fool which I would be had
      killed within me the higher man. I was almost proud to have succeeded in
      deceiving men; that they mistook my grotesque mask for my real face; that
      they point the finger at me, and laugh, saying to each other: &lsquo;That is a
      fool, an original, whom Nature herself has chosen as a kind of court fool
      to society.&rsquo; No one has understood the cry of distress of my soul. Those
      who laughed at the comical fellow by day, little dreamed of the anguish
      and misery in which he sighed away the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You not only wrong yourself, but you wrong mankind,&rdquo; said Goethe, kindly.
      &ldquo;In the world, and in literature, you bear an honored name; every one of
      education is familiar with your excellent work on &lsquo;Prosody of the German
      Language&rsquo;&mdash;has read also your spirited Journey to England. You have
      no right to ask that one should separate the kernel from the shell in
      hastily passing by. If you surround yourself with a wall bedaubed with
      caricatures, you cannot expect that people will look behind what seems an
      entrance to a puppet-show, to find holy temples, blooming gardens, or a
      church-yard filled with graves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what I resemble,&rdquo; said Moritz, with a melancholy air. &ldquo;From
      the depths of my soul it seems so. Nothing but buried hopes, murdered
      ideals, and wishes trodden under foot. From childhood I have exerted
      myself against circumstances; I have striven my whole life&mdash;a pledge
      of my being against unpropitious Fate. Although the son of a poor
      tradesman, Nature had given me a thirst for knowledge, a love for science
      and art. On account of it I passed for a stupid idler in the family, who
      would not contribute to his own support. Occupation with books was
      accounted idleness and laziness by my father. I was driven to work with
      blows and ill-treatment; and, that I might the sooner equal my father as a
      good shoemaker, I was bound to the stool near his own. During the long,
      fearful days I was forced to sit and draw the pitched, offensive thread
      through the leather, and when my arms were lame, and sank weary at my
      side, then I was invigorated to renewed exertion with blows. Finally, with
      the courage of despair, I fled from this life of torture. Unacquainted
      with the world, and inexperienced, I hoped for the sympathy of men, but in
      vain. No one would relieve or assist me! Days and weeks long I have
      wandered around in the forest adjoining our little village, and lived like
      the animals, upon roots and herbs. Yet I was happy! I had taken with me in
      my flight two books which I had received as prizes, in the happy days that
      my father permitted me to go to the Latin school. The decision of the
      teacher that I was created for a scholar, so terrified my father, that he
      took me from the school, to turn the embryo savant, who would be good for
      nothing, into a shoemaker, who might earn his bread. My two darling books
      remained to me. In the forest solitude I read Ovid and Virgil until I had
      memorized them, and recited them aloud, in pathetic tones, for my own
      amusement. To-day I recall those weeks in the forest stillness as the
      happiest, purest, and most beautiful of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they undoubtedly are,&rdquo; said Goethe, kindly. &ldquo;The return to Nature is
      the return to one&rsquo;s self. Who will be an able, vigorous man and remain so,
      must, above all things, live in and with Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But oh! this happy life did not long continue,&rdquo; sighed Moritz. &ldquo;My father
      discovered my retreat, and came with sheriffs and bailiffs to seize me
      like a criminal&mdash;like a wild animal. With my hands bound, I was
      brought back in broad day, amid the jeers of street boys. Permit me to
      pass in silence the degradation, the torture which followed. I became a
      burden to myself, and longed for death. The ill-treatment of my father
      finally revived my courage to run away the second time. I went to a large
      town near by, and decided to earn my living rather than return to my
      father. To fulfil the prophecy of my teacher was my ambition. The
      privations that I endured, the life I led, I will not recount to you. I
      performed the most menial service, and worked months like a beast of
      burden. For want of a shelter, I slept in deserted yards and tumble-down
      houses. Upon a piece of bread and a drink of water I lived, saving, with
      miserly greediness, the money which I earned as messenger or day-laborer.
      At the end of a year, I had earned sufficient to buy an old suit of
      clothes at a second-hand clothing-store, and present myself to the
      director of the Gymnasium, imploring him to receive me as pupil. Bitterly
      weeping, I opened my heart to him, and disclosed the torture of my sad
      life as a child, and begged him to give me the opportunity to educate
      myself. He repulsed me with scorn, and threatened to give me over to the
      police, as a runaway, as a vagabond, and beggar. &lsquo;I am no beggar!&rsquo; I
      cried, vehemently, &lsquo;I will be under obligation to no one. I have money to
      pay for two years in advance, and during this time I shall be able to earn
      sufficient to pay for the succeeding two years.&rsquo; This softened the anger
      of the crabbed director; he was friendly and kind, and promised me his
      assistance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy!&rdquo; sighed Goethe. &ldquo;So young, and yet forced to learn that there
      is a power to which not only kings and princes, but mind must bow; to
      which science and art have submitted, as to their Maecenas! This power
      opened the doors of the Gymnasium to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was even thus. The director took pity upon me, and permitted me to
      enter upon my studies at once; he did more, he assured my future. Oh, he
      was a humane and kind man! When he learned that I possessed nothing but
      the little sum to which the drops of blood of a year&rsquo;s toil still clung,
      then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He returned it to you,&rdquo; interrupted Goethe, kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he offered me board, lodging, and clothing, during my course at the
      Gymnasium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was well,&rdquo; cried Goethe. &ldquo;Tell me the name of this honorable man,
      that I may meet him and extend to him my hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A troubled smile spread over Philip&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Permit me for the time being
      to conceal the name,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I received the generous proposal
      gratefully, and asked, deeply moved, if there were no services which I
      could return for so much kindness and generosity. It proved that there
      were, and the director made them known to me. He was unmarried, hence the
      necessity of men&rsquo;s service. I should be society for him&mdash;be a
      companion, in fact; I should do what every grateful son would do for his
      father&mdash;help him dress, keep his room in order, and prepare his
      breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That meant that you should be his servant!&rdquo; cried Goethe, indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only in the morning,&rdquo; replied Moritz, smiling. &ldquo;Evenings and nights I
      should have the honor to be his amanuensis; I should look over the studies
      of the scholars, and correct their exercises; and when I had made
      sufficient progress, it should be my duty to give two hours to different
      classes, and I should read aloud or play cards with the director on
      leisure evenings. Besides, I was obliged to promise never to leave the
      house without his permission; never to speak to, or hold intercourse with,
      any one outside the hours of instruction. All these conditions were
      written down, and signed by both parties, as if a business contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A transaction by which a human soul was bargained for!&rdquo; thundered Goethe.
      &ldquo;Reveal to me, now, the name of this trader of souls, that I may expose
      him to public shame!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He died a year since,&rdquo; replied Moritz, softened. &ldquo;God summoned him to
      judgment. When the physician announced to him that the cancer was
      incurable, when he felt death approaching, he sent for me, and begged my
      forgiveness, with tears and deep contrition. I forgave him, so let me
      cease to recall the life I passed with him. By the sweat of my brow I was
      compelled to serve him; for seven long years I was his slave. I sold
      myself for the sake of knowledge, I was consoled by progress. I was the
      servant, companion, jester, and slave of my tyrant, but I was also the
      disciple, the priest of learning. In my own room my chains fell off. In
      the lonely night-watches I communed with the great, the immortal spirits
      of Horace, Virgil, and even the proud Caesar, and the divine Homer. Those
      solitary but happy hours of the night are never to be forgotten, never to
      be portrayed; they refreshed me for the trials of the day, and enabled me
      to endure them! At the close of seven years I was prepared to enter the
      university, and the bargain between my master and myself was also at an
      end. Freed from my tyrant, I bent my steps toward Frankfort University, to
      feel my liberty enchained anew. For seven years I had been the slave of
      the director; now I became the slave of poverty, forced to labor to live!
      Oh, I cannot recall those scenes! Suffice it to say, that during one year
      I had no fixed abode, never tasted warm food. But it is passed&mdash;I
      have conquered! After years of struggle, of exertion, of silent misery,
      only relieved by my stolen hours of blissful study, I gained my reward. I
      was free! My examination passed, I was honored with the degrees of Doctor
      of Philosophy and Master of Arts. After many intervening events, I was
      appointed conrector of the college attached to the Gray Monastery, which
      position now supports me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be praised, I breathe freely!&rdquo; answered Goethe, with one of those
      sunny smiles which, in a moment of joyful excitement, lighted up his face.
      &ldquo;I feel like one shipwrecked, who has, at last, reached a safe harbor. I
      rejoice in your rescue as if it were my own. Now you are safe. You have
      reached the port, and in the quiet happiness of your own library you will
      win new laurels. Why, then, still dispirited and unhappy? The past, with
      its sorrows and humiliations, is forgotten, the present is satisfactory,
      and the future is full of hope for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Full of misery is the present,&rdquo; cried Philip, angrily, &ldquo;and filled with
      despair I glance at the future. You do not see it with your divine eyes,
      you do not perceive it, poet with the sympathetic soul. You, too, thought
      that Philip Moritz had only a head for the sciences, and forgot that he
      had a heart to love. I tell you that he has a warm, affectionate heart,
      torn with grief and all the tortures of jealousy; that disappointed
      happiness maddens him. I was not created to be happy, and my whole being
      longs for happiness. Oh! I would willingly give my life for one day by the
      side of the one I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not trifle,&rdquo; said Goethe, angrily. &ldquo;He who has striven and struggled
      as you have, dare not offer, for any woman, however beautiful and
      seductive, to yield his life, which has been destined to a higher aim than
      mere success in love. Perhaps you think that God has infused a ray of His
      intelligence into the mind of man, created him immortal, and breathed upon
      him with His world-creating breath only, to make him happy, and find that
      happiness in love! No! my friend, God has given to man like faculties with
      Himself, and inspired him, that he might be a worthy representative of Him
      upon the earth; that he should prove, in his life, that he is not only the
      blossom, but the fruit also, of God&rsquo;s creation. Love is to man the perfume
      of his existence. She may intoxicate him for a while, may inspire him to
      poetical effusions, to great deeds, even; but he should hesitate to let
      her become his mistress, to let her be the tyrant of his existence. If she
      would enchain him, he must tear himself away, even if he tear out his own
      heart. Man possesses that which is more ennobling than mere feeling; he
      has intellect&mdash;soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Moritz, &ldquo;it is easy to see that you have never loved madly,
      despairingly. You have never seen the woman whom you adore, and who
      perhaps reciprocates your passion, forced to marry another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shadow flitted over Goethe&rsquo;s brow, and the flashing brilliancy of his
      eyes was changed to gloomy sadness. Gently, but quickly, he laid his hand
      upon Moritz&rsquo;s shoulder, saying: &ldquo;In this hour, when two souls are revealed
      to each other, will I acknowledge to you that which I have never spoken
      of. I, too, love a woman, who loves me, and yet can never be mine, for she
      is married to another. I love this sweet woman as I have never loved a
      mortal being. For years my existence has belonged to her, she has been the
      centre of all my thoughts. It would seem to me as if the earth were
      without a sun, heaven without a God, if she should vanish from life. I
      even bless the torture which her prudery, her alternate coldness and
      friendliness cause me, as it comes from her, from the highest bliss of
      feeling. This passion has swept through my soul, as if uniting in itself
      all my youthful loves, till, like a torrent, ever renewing itself, ever
      moving onward, it has become the highway of my future. Upon this stream
      floats the bark laden with all my happiness, fame, and poetry. The palaces
      which my fancy creates rise upon its shore. Every zephyr, however slight,
      makes me tremble. Every cloud which overshadows the brow of my beloved,
      sweeps like a tempest over my own. I live upon her smile. A kind word
      falling from her lips makes me happy for days; and when she turns away
      from me with coldness and indifference, I feel like one driven about as
      Orestes by the Furies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You really are in love!&rdquo; cried Moritz. &ldquo;I will take back what I have
      said. You, the chosen of the gods, know all the human heart can suffer,
      even unhappy love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost angry, and with hesitation, Goethe answered him: &ldquo;I do not call
      this passion of mine an unhappy one, for in the very perception of it lies
      happiness. We are only wretched when we lose self-control. To this point
      Love shall never lead me. She yields me the highest delight, but she shall
      never bring me to self-destruction. Grief for her may, like a destructive
      whirlwind, crush every blossom of my heart; but she shall never destroy
      me. The man, the poet, must stand higher than the lover; for where the
      latter is about to yield to despair, the former will rise, and, with the
      defiance of Prometheus, challenge the gods to recognize the godlike
      similitude, that man can rise superior to sorrow, never despairing, never
      cursing Fate if all the rosy dreams of youth are not realities, but with
      upturned gaze stride over the waste places of life, consoling himself with
      the thought that only magnanimous souls can suffer and conquer
      magnanimously. Vanquished grief brings us nearer to the immortal, and
      gradually bears us from this vale of sorrow up to the brighter heights,
      nearer to God&mdash;the earth with her petty confusion lying like a
      worthless tool at our feet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is heavenly to be able to say that, and divine to perceive it,&rdquo; cried
      Moritz, bursting into tears. &ldquo;The miseries of life chain me to the dust,
      and do not permit me to mount to the heights which a hero like Goethe
      reaches victorious. It is indeed sublime to conquer one&rsquo;s self, and be
      willing to resign the happiness which flees us. But see how weak I am&mdash;I
      cannot do it! I can never give up the one I love. It seems as if I could
      move heaven and earth to conquer at last, and that I must die if I do not
      succeed&mdash;die like Werther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe&rsquo;s eyes flashed with anger, and with heightened color he exclaimed:
      &ldquo;You all repeat the same litany&mdash;do not make me answerable for all
      your weaknesses, and blame poor Werther for the creations of your own
      imagination. I, who am the author of Werther, am free from this abominable
      sentimentality. Why cannot others be, who only read what I have conceived?
      But pardon my violence,&rdquo; he continued, with a milder voice and gentler
      manner. &ldquo;Never did an author create a work which brought him at the same
      time so great fame and bitter reproach as this work has brought to me.
      &lsquo;The Sorrows of Young Werther&rsquo; have indeed been transformed into the
      sorrows of young Goethe, and I even fear that old Goethe will have to
      suffer for it. I have spoken to you as a friend to a friend: cherish my
      words, take them to heart, and arise from the dust; shake off the
      self-strewn ashes from your head. Enter again as a brave champion the
      combat of life&mdash;summon to your aid cunning, power, prudence, and
      audacity, to conquer your love. Whether you succeed or not, then you aim
      at the greatest of battles&mdash;that of mind over matter&mdash;then
      remember my farewell words. From the power which binds all men he frees
      himself who conquers himself.&mdash;Farewell! If ever you need the
      encouragement of a friend, if ever a sympathizing soul is necessary to
      you, come to Weimar; sympathy and appreciation shall never fail you
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I will surely go,&rdquo; answered Moritz, deeply moved, and pressing
      heartily Goethe&rsquo;s offered hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing more I have to say to you: Live much with Nature; accustom
      yourself to regard the sparrow, the flower, or the stone, as worthy of
      your attention as the wonderful phoenix or the monuments of the ancients
      with their illegible inscriptions. To walk with Nature is balsam for a
      weary soul; gently touched by her soft hands, the recovery is most rapid.
      I have experienced it, and do experience it daily. Now, once more,
      farewell; in the true sense of the word fare-thee-well! I wish that I
      could help you in other ways than by mere kind words. It pains me indeed
      that I can render you no other aid or hope. You alone can do what none
      other can do for you.&mdash;Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and motioning to Moritz not to follow him, almost flew down the
      stairs into the street. Drawing a long breath, he stood leaning against
      the door, gazing at the crowd&mdash;at the busy passers-by&mdash;some
      merrily chatting with their companions, others with earnest mien and in
      busy haste. No one seemed to care for him, no one looked at him. If by
      chance they glanced at him, Johann Wolfgang Goethe was of no more
      consequence to them than any other honest citizen in a neighboring
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without perhaps acknowledging it to himself, Goethe was a little vexed
      that no one observed him; that the weather-maker from Weimar, who was
      accustomed to be greeted there, and everywhere, indeed, with smiles and
      bows, should here in Berlin be only an ordinary mortal&mdash;a stranger
      among strangers. &ldquo;I would not live here,&rdquo; said he, as he walked slowly
      down the street. &ldquo;What are men in great cities but grains of sand, now
      blown together and then asunder? There is no individuality, one is only a
      unit in the mass! But it is well occasionally to look into such a
      kaleidoscope, and admire the play of colors, which I have done, and with a
      glad heart I will now fly home to all my friends&mdash;to you, beloved one&mdash;to
      you, Charlotte!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI. THE INNER AND THE MIDDLE TEMPLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine Enke had passed the day in great anxiety and excitement, and
      not even the distraction of her new possession had been able to calm the
      beating of her heart or allay her fears. Prince Frederick William had
      arrived early in the morning, to bid her farewell, as he was to march in
      the course of the day with his regiments from Potsdam. With the tenderest
      assurances of love he took leave of Wilhelmine, and with tears kissed his
      two children, pressing them to his heart. As he was about to enter his
      carriage he returned to the house to embrace his weeping mistress, and
      reassure her of his fidelity, and make her promise him again and again
      that she would remain true to him, and never love another.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not alone the farewell to her beloved prince which caused
      Wilhelmine such anxiety and made her so restless. Like a dark cloud the
      remembrance of Cagliostro&rsquo;s mysterious appearance arose in her mind,
      overshadowing her every hour more and more, filling her soul with terror.
      In vain did she seek refuge near her children, trying to cheer and forget
      herself in their innocent amusement&mdash;one moment running about the
      garden with them, then returning to the house to reexamine it. Her
      thoughts would revert to Cagliostro, and the solemnities which were to
      take place at her house that night. The thought terrified her that at
      nightfall she was obliged to send away all her servants, and not even be
      permitted to lock herself in the lonely, deserted house. For the great
      magician had commanded her to let the doors of her house stand open; he
      would place sentinels at every entrance, and none but the elect would be
      allowed to enter. Wilhelmine had not the courage to resist this command.
      As evening approached, she sent the cook, with other servants, to her
      apartment at Berlin, ordering them to pack her furniture and other
      effects, and send them by a hired wagon to Charlottenburg the following
      morning. An hour previous to this she had sent the nurse and two children
      to Potsdam with a similar commission, ordering them to return early the
      next day. Alone she now awaited with feverish anxiety Cagliostro&rsquo;s
      appearance. Again and again she wandered through the silent, deserted
      rooms frightened at the sound of her own footsteps, and peering into each
      room as if an assassin or robber were lurking there. She had many enemies&mdash;many
      there were who cursed her, and, alas! none loved her&mdash;she was
      friendless, save the prince, who was far away. The tears which the
      princess had shed on her account weighed like a heavy burden upon her
      heart, burning into her very soul in this hour of lonely, sad
      retrospection. She tried in vain to excuse herself, in the fact that she
      had loved the prince before his marriage; that she had sacrificed herself
      to him through affection, and that she was not entitled to become his
      wife, as she was not born under the canopy of a throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the depths of her conscience there again rose the tearful, sad face
      of the princess, accusing her as an adulteress&mdash;as a sinner before
      God and man! Terrified, she cried: &ldquo;I have truly loved him, and I do still
      love him; this is my excuse and my justification. She is not to be pitied
      who can walk openly by the side of her husband, enjoying the respect and
      sympathy of all to whom homage is paid, and who, one day, will be queen! I
      am the only one, I alone! I stand in the shade, despised and scorned,
      avoided and shunned by every one. Those who recognize me, do so with a
      mocking smile, and when I pass by they contemptuously shrug their
      shoulders and say to one another, &lsquo;That was Enke, the mistress of the
      Prince of Prussia!&rsquo; All this shall be changed,&rdquo; she cried aloud; &ldquo;I will
      not always be despised and degraded! I will be revenged on my crushed and
      scorned youth! I will have rank and name, honor and position, that I will&mdash;yes,
      that I will, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine wandered on through the silent rooms, all brilliantly
      illuminated, a precaution she had taken before dismissing her servants.
      The bright light was a consolation to her, and, at least, she could not be
      attacked by surprise, but see her enemy, and escape. &ldquo;I was a fool,&rdquo; she
      murmured, &ldquo;to grant Cagliostro this reception to-night. I know that he is
      a charlatan! There are no prophets or wizards! Yet, well I remember,
      though a stranger to me, in Paris, how truthfully he brought before me my
      past life; with what marvellous exactness he revealed to me secrets known
      only to my Maker and myself. Cagliostro must be a wizard, then, or a
      prophet; he has wonderful power over me also, and reads my most secret
      thoughts. He will assist me to rise from my shame and degradation to an
      honored position. I shall become a rich and influential woman! I will
      confide in him, never doubting him&mdash;for he is my master and savior!
      Away with fear! He has said that the house should be guarded, and it will
      be! Onward then, Wilhelmine, without fear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hastened to the large drawing-room, in order to see the effect of the
      numerous wax-lights in the superb chandeliers of rock crystal. The great
      folding-doors resisted all her efforts to open them. &ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; cried
      a loud, threatening voice. Trembling and with beating heart Wilhelmine
      leaned against the door, giddy with fear, when a second demand, &ldquo;Who is
      there? The watchword! No one can pass without the countersign!&rdquo; roused
      her, and she stole back on tiptoe to her room. &ldquo;He has kept his word, the
      doors are guarded!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I will go and await him in my
      sitting-room.&rdquo; She stepped quickly forward, when suddenly she thought she
      heard footsteps stealing behind her; turning, she beheld two men wrapped
      in black cloaks, with black masks, stealthily creeping after her.
      Wilhelmine shrieked with terror, tore open the door, rushed across the
      next room into her own boudoir. As she entered a glance revealed to her
      that the two masks approached nearer and nearer. She bolted the door
      quickly, sinking to the floor with fright and exhaustion. &ldquo;What are they
      going to do? Will they force open the door and murder me? How foolish, how
      fearfully foolish to have sent away all my servants. Now I understand it:
      Cagliostro is not only an impostor&mdash;a charlatan, but he is a thief
      and an assassin. I have been caught in the trap set for me, like a
      credulous fool! He and his associates will rob me and plunder my beautiful
      villa, but just given to me, and, when they have secured all, murder me to
      escape betrayal.&rdquo; With deep contrition, weeping and trembling, Wilhelmine
      accused herself of her credulity and folly. For the first time in her life
      she was dismayed and cowardly, for it was the first time that she had had
      to tremble for her possessions. It was something so new, so unaccustomed
      to her to possess any thing, that it made her anxious, and she feared, as
      in the fairy tale, that it would dissolve into nothing. By degrees her
      presence of mind and equanimity were restored. The stillness was unbroken&mdash;and
      no one forced the door, to murder the mistress of this costly possession.
      Gathering courage, she rose softly and stole to the window. The moon shone
      brightly and clearly. The house stood sideways to the street, and
      separated from it, first by thick shrubbery, and then a trellised lawn.
      Whoever would enter, directly turned into a path leading from the street
      into the shrubbery. Just upon this walk, Wilhelmine perceived masked men
      approaching, one by one, as in a procession&mdash;slowly, silently moving
      on, until they neared the gate of the trellised square, where two tall,
      dark forms were stationed to demand the countersign, which being given,
      they passed over the lawn into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take courage; he has told me the truth, the house is well
      guarded,&rdquo; murmured Wilhelmine. &ldquo;None but the summoned can enter; I belong
      to the number, and when it is time Cagliostro will come and fetch me.
      Until then, let me await quietly the result,&rdquo; said she, as she stretched
      herself comfortably upon the sofa, laughing at her former cowardice and
      terror. &ldquo;No one can enter this room unless I open the door, and
      fortunately there is but one exit. The wizard himself could not gain
      admittance unless the walls should open or the bolt drive hack for him.
      Hark! it strikes eleven, one tedious hour longer to wait. I must try to
      rest a little.&rdquo; She laid her head upon the cushion, closing her eyes. The
      calm and the quiet were refreshing after the excitement of the day.
      Gradually her thoughts became confused&mdash;dim pictures floated past her
      mental vision, her breathing became shorter, and she slept. The stillness
      was unbroken, save the clock striking the quarters of every hour. Scarcely
      had the last quarter to midnight sounded, when the window was softly
      opened, and a dark form descended into the room. He listened a moment,
      looking at the sleeping one, who moved not; then extinguished the light,
      creeping toward the door. Wilhelmine slept on. Suddenly it seemed to her
      as if sunbeams blinded her, and she started up from a profound sleep. It
      was indeed no dream. A white form stood before her of dazzling brilliancy,
      as if formed of sun-rays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise and follow me!&rdquo; cried a commanding voice. &ldquo;The Great Kophta commands
      you. Mask yourself, and, as your life is dear to you, do not raise it for
      one instant!&rdquo; Wilhelmine took the mask, upon which flickered a little blue
      flame, and held it close to her face. &ldquo;Pray in spirit, then follow me.&rdquo;
       Wilhelmine followed without opposition the bright form which moved before
      her through the dark rooms. She felt as if under the influence of a charm;
      her heart beat violently, her feet trembled, but still she felt no more
      wavering or fear; a joyous confidence filled her whole being. With her
      eyes bent upon the moving form of light, she went onward in the obscurity,
      and entered the great drawing-room, where profound darkness and silence
      reigned. A slight murmur, as of those in prayer, fell on her car, and it
      seemed as if numberless black shadows were moving about. &ldquo;Kneel and pray,&rdquo;
       whispered a voice near her. Her conductor had disappeared, and the gloom
      of night surrounded her. Wilhelmine knelt as she was bidden, but she could
      not pray; breathless expectation and eager curiosity banished all devotion
      and composure. Occasionally was heard, amid the silence and darkness, a
      deep sigh, a suppressed groan, or a shriek, which died away in the
      murmuring of prayer. Suddenly a strange music broke the stillness&mdash;sharp,
      piercing tones, resonant as bells, and increasing in power, sometimes as
      rich and full as the peals of an organ, then gentle and soft as the
      murmuring wind, or a sorrow-laden sigh. Then, human voices joined the
      music, swelling it to a wonderful and harmonious choir&mdash;to an
      inspired song of aspiration, Of fervent expectation, and imploring the
      coming of him who would bring glory and peace, filling the hearts of
      believers with godliness. The chorus of the Invisibles had not ceased,
      when a strange blue light began to glimmer at the farther end of the room;
      then it shot like a flash through the dark space. As their dazzled eyes
      were again raised, they saw in a kind of halo, in the midst of golden
      clouds, a tall, dazzling figure, in a long, flowing robe, sparkling with
      silver. The lovely bust, the beautiful arms and shoulders, were covered
      with a transparent golden tissue, over which fell the long, curly hair to
      the waist. A glittering band, sparkling like stars, was wound through the
      hair, which surrounded a feminine face of surpassing beauty. Perpetual
      youth glowed upon her full, rosy cheeks; bright intelligence beamed from
      the clear, lofty brow; peace, joy, and happiness, were revealed in the
      smile of the red lips; love and passion flashed from the large, brilliant
      eyes. The choir of the Invisibles now sang in jubilant tones: &ldquo;The eternal
      Virgin, the everlasting, holy, and pure being, greets the erring, blesses
      those that seek, causing them to find, and partake with joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The heavenly woman raised her lovely arms, extending them as if for a
      tender embrace. A captivating smile lighted up her features; a fiery
      glance from her beautiful eyes seemed to greet every one, separately, to
      announce to them joy and hope. While they regarded her entranced with
      delight, the golden cloud grew denser, and covered the virgin with her
      luminous veil. It then gradually disappeared, with the golden splendor.
      The chorus of the Invisibles ceased, and the music died away in gentle
      murmurs. Upon the spot where the beaming apparition was visible, there now
      stood a tall priest, in a long, flowing black robe; a pale-blue light
      surrounded him, and rendered the dark outline distinctly visible by the
      clear background. Snow-white hair and a black mask made him unrecognizable
      to every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Extending his arms, as if blessing them, the masked one cried: &ldquo;My
      beloved, the unknown fathers of our Holy Order of Rosicrucians send me to
      you, and command me to salute you with the greeting of life. I am to
      announce to you that the time of revelation approaches, and that the
      sublime mysteries of earth and Nature will soon be revealed to you. As the
      rose is unfolded in her glowing red, which has so long slept in her lap of
      green leaves, you represent the green leaves, and Nature is the rose. She
      will disclose herself to you with all her secrets. In her calyx you will
      find the elixir of life and the secret of gold, if you walk in the path of
      duty; if you exercise unconditional obedience to the Invisible Fathers; if
      you submit yourselves in blind confidence to their wisdom; if you swear to
      abstain from every self-inquiry, and to distrust your own understanding.&rdquo;
       <i>[Footnote: So run the very words in the laws of the Rosicrucians.&mdash;See
      &ldquo;New General German Library,&rdquo; vol. lvi., p. 10.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We swear it!&rdquo; cried solemn voices on all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear, blindly, silent obedience to all that the Invisible Fathers shall
      announce to you through their directors, or shall order you under the holy
      sign of the Rosicrucians by word or writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We swear it!&rdquo; again resounded in solemn chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame, disgrace, perdition, and destruction, be your curse,&rdquo; thundered
      the priest, &ldquo;if you deviate in thought even from your oath; if you seek to
      ponder and reflect; if you measure by your own limited reason the
      dispositions and operations of the sublime fathers, to whom Nature has
      revealed herself, and to whom all the secrets of heaven and earth are
      disclosed. Eternal destruction, and all the tortures of hell and
      purgatory, be the portion of the doubting! Damned and proscribed be the
      traitor to the holy order! Listen, ye spirits of the deep, and ye spirits
      of darkness, withdraw from here in terror, ere the anger of the Invisible
      Fathers fall upon you like destroying lightning! Open, ye doors, that the
      wicked may flee, and only the good remain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a wave of the hand the great folding-doors now opened, and a flood of
      light from the adjoining apartment revealed the drawingroom to be filled
      with the dark forms of men enveloped in black cloaks, hoods drawn over the
      heads, and black masks covering the faces&mdash;all kneeling close
      together and exactly resembling one another. No one moved, the doors
      closed again, darkness reigning. The priest was no longer visible, though
      continuing to speak: &ldquo;Only the good and obedient are now assembled here,
      and to them I announce that life is to us, and death awaits beyond the
      door to seize the traitor who would disclose the holy secrets of the
      order. Be faithful, my brothers, and never forget that there is no place
      on the earth where the traitor is secure from the avenging sword of the
      Invisible Fathers. None but the good and obedient being here assembled, I
      now announce to you that the time of revelation approaches, and that it
      will come when you are all zealously endeavoring to extend the holy order,
      and augment the number of brothers. For the extension of the order is
      nothing less than universal happiness. It emanates alone from the
      Invisible Fathers, who link heaven to earth and who will open again the
      lost way to Paradise. The supreme chiefs of our holy order are the rulers
      of all Nature, reposing in God the Father. <i>[Footnote: The wording of
      the laws of the Order of the Rosicrucians.&mdash;See &ldquo;New General German
      Library,&rdquo; vol. M., p. 10.]</i> They are the favorites of God, whom the
      Trinity thinks worthy of his highest confidence and revelation. If you
      will take part in the revelations of God, and witness the disclosing of
      the hidden treasures of Nature, swear that you will be obedient to the
      holy order, and that you will strive to gain new members.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We swear it,&rdquo; resounded in an inspired chorus through the room. &ldquo;We swear
      unconditional obedience to the Invisible Fathers. We swear to strive with
      all our means for the extension of the holy order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unbelief, free-thinking, and self-knowledge are of the devil, who steals
      abroad, to turn men from God. The pride of reason seeks to misguide men,
      and lead them away from God and the secrets of Nature. The devil has
      chosen his disciples, who teach sinful knowledge and arrogant
      free-thinking, and who are united in Berlin in the Order of the
      Illuminati. The Invisible Fathers command you to fight this shameful order
      in word, deed, and writing. If any of you are acquainted with one of the
      members, you shall regard him as your most deadly enemy, and shall hate
      and pursue him as you hate sin and as you pursue crime. You shall flee his
      intercourse as you would that of the devil, otherwise you will be damned,
      and the Invisible Fathers never will forgive you, and the secrets of
      Nature will be withheld from you. Swear therefore hate, persecution, and
      eternal enmity, to the Order of the Illuminati. This I command you in the
      name of the Invisible Fathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We swear it! We swear hate, persecution, and eternal enmity, to the Order
      of the Illuminati!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one who belongs to the order is damned and cursed; and if it were
      your brother or your father, so shall you curse and damn him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We swear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I bring you the blessing of the Invisible rulers and fathers, who
      announce to you, through me, that every lost one which you gain for the
      Order of the Rosicrucians, and consequently lead back to God and Nature,
      is a step toward entering the holy sanctuary of revelation, where the
      elixir of life and the tincture of gold awaits you. Every cursed member of
      the Illuminati becomes one of the blessed when you lead him from the path
      of vice in penitence and contrition, and gain him to the Order of the
      Rosicrucians; and he who can prove that he has gained twelve new members
      for our holy order mounts a round higher in the ladder of knowledge, and
      rises to a new degree. At the sixth grade he passes from the Inner to the
      Middle Temple, where all the secrets of the universe and of Nature are
      disclosed. Be mindful of this, and recruit. Until we meet again, let the
      watchword be, &lsquo;Curses and persecution for the devil&rsquo;s offspring, the
      Illuminati!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curses and persecution for the devil&rsquo;s offspring, the Illuminati, we
      swear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now depart! Pay your tribute at the door, which you owe, and receive in
      return the new sign of the order, which will serve to make the brothers
      known to each other. Only the directors and the members of the sixth grade
      shall knock again at this door after paying tribute, and, receiving the
      new word of life, the guard will let them enter. Depart! I dismiss you in
      the name of the Holy Father and the Trinity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this cloak, and cover yourself, that no one can recognize you,&rdquo;
       whispered a person near Wilhelmine, and threw a soft covering over her.
      &ldquo;Will you now depart, or seek further in the way of knowledge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will seek further,&rdquo; answered Wilhelmine, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wish to enter the sixth grade, and learn the secrets of Nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will give you the watchword of the order. But woe unto you if you
      reveal it! Swear that you will never betray it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine felt a hot breath upon her cheek, and a voice whispered in her
      ear the significant words: &ldquo;Now depart; pay your tribute, you cannot tarry
      here. Go, and return with the chosen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A hand seized her arm and conducted her to the door. Almost blinded by the
      bright light, she entered the adjoining apartment, where it seemed as if
      she saw through a veil muffled figures go forward to the centre, and
      deposit money in a marble basin which stood upon a kind of altar; naphtha
      burned in silver basins upon each end of it, and a muffled figure stood
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine advanced to the altar, and with quick decision drew a diamond
      ring from her finger, and begged permission to deposit it instead of
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The muffled figure bowed, and handed to her the new watchword&mdash;a
      picture of a Madonna, with the sign of the Rosicrucians underneath. Then
      she returned, and awaited at the door, with a little gathering, which must
      consequently belong to the sixth grade. Gradually the others had
      withdrawn; the naphtha-flames upon the altar were extinguished, and the
      wax-lights of the centre lustres had grown dim, and gradually extinguished
      themselves. Soon the doors were opened, and a bright light, as of the
      sun&rsquo;s rays, filled the hall. Three blasts of trumpets sounded, and a choir
      of immortal voices sang, &ldquo;Enter, ye blessed ones! Enter, ye elect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They entered, whispering the sign to the guards, who stood with drawn
      swords, and passed on to the throne upon which stood a couch, surrounded
      with blooming flowers and covered with a cloud of silvery gauze. They soon
      discovered a secret something was hidden under the cloud, though they knew
      not whether it were child, woman, or man. They knelt upon the lower step
      of the throne, with folded hands and bowed heads, praying in a low voice.
      A solemn stillness reigned, the prayers died away on the lips, and the
      hearts scarcely beat for anxiety and expectation. Suddenly a voice, which
      seemed to come from the silver cloud, so distant and lofty, and rolling
      like majestic thunder, cried, &ldquo;He comes, the chosen one! The Great Kophta
      comes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The folding-doors flew open, and the Great Kophta entered. Wilhelmine
      recognized in the majestic figure, enveloped in a flowing,
      silver-embroidered satin robe, with a band of brilliants around his brow,
      the handsome face of Cagliostro, beaming as if in an ecstasy. He saluted
      the brothers with a gentle voice, and bade them approach and touch his
      hand. As Wilhelmine did so, a thrill ran through her whole being, and she
      sank overpowered at his feet. He bowed and breathed upon her. &ldquo;You are
      chosen, ye heavenly brothers,&rdquo; he said, in a sweet, melodious voice; &ldquo;the
      secrets of heaven and earth are disclosed to you. I receive you in the
      Holy Order of the Favorites of God, which I founded with Enoch and Elias
      when we dwelt in the promised land. From them I received the Word of Life,
      and they sent me to the ancient sages of Egypt, who revealed to me in the
      pyramids the secret sciences which subject the earth and all her treasures
      to our command. He who devotes himself to me with fidelity will receive
      eternal life and the secret of immortality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We believe in thee, blessed one of God,&rdquo; murmured the kneeling ones; &ldquo;we
      know that we receive life and salvation from thee. Bend to us, and give us
      of the breath of immortality!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed and breathed upon them, and they broke forth in words of
      thankfulness and delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only Wilhelmine kept silent; she only failed to feel the magical
      influence, and he bowed again to her, fixing his great fiery eyes upon
      her. &ldquo;Thou art called, thou art chosen,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mount to the
      tabernacle, and lift the veil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did as commanded, and beheld the figure of a wonderful woman stretched
      upon the couch as in deep sleep, clothed in transparent robes. &ldquo;Lay your
      hand upon her brow, and direct in your thoughts a question to the
      prophetess of the order, and she will answer you!&rdquo; Upon the lofty, white
      brow of the sleeping one, she laid her hand; immediately a smile flitted
      over her beautiful face, and she nodded. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you must
      believe. You dare not doubt. He is the elect, the holy Magus!&rdquo; Wilhelmine
      trembled, for the answer was suited to the question. &ldquo;Demand a second
      question of the prophetess,&rdquo; commanded Cagliostro. Again she laid her hand
      upon the brow of the sleeping one, and again she smiled and nodded with
      her beautiful head. &ldquo;Fear not,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;he will always love you, and
      will never reject you, only you must not lead him astray from the right
      course&mdash;but guide him to the temple of faith and knowledge. When you
      cease to do it, you are lost. Shame upon earth and damnation will be your
      portion.&rdquo; The answer was exact&mdash;for Wilhelmine had prayed to know if
      the prince would always love and never reject her. &ldquo;Still a third
      question,&rdquo; cried Cagliostro. In silence Wilhelmine asked, and the
      prophetess answered aloud: &ldquo;You will be countess, you will become a
      princess, you will possess millions, you will have the whole world at your
      feet, if you call to your aid the Invisible Fathers, and implore the power
      and miraculous blessing of the Great Kophta.&rdquo; Wilhelmine, deeply moved,
      sank overpowered upon her knees, and cried aloud: &ldquo;I call upon the
      Invisible Fathers for aid and assistance; I implore the power and
      miraculous blessing of the Great Kophta.&rdquo; Suddenly, amid the rolling of
      thunder and intense darkness, Wilhelmine felt herself lifted up&mdash;borne
      away, as loud prayers were uttered around her. Then she felt herself
      lowered again and with the freedom of motion. &ldquo;Fly! fly from the revenge
      of the immortals, if you still doubt, still mistrust!&rdquo; cried a fearful
      voice above her. &ldquo;Behold how the immortals revenge themselves.&rdquo;
       Immediately a light began to dawn before her, a form rose from the
      darkness like her own. She beheld herself kneeling, imploring, her face
      deluged with tears, and before her a tall, erect, muffled figure, with a
      glittering sword in his uplifted arm, which sank gradually lower and lower
      until it pierced her bosom and the blood gushed forth. Wilhelmine shrieked
      and fainted. She witnessed no more miracles, beard no more prophecies and
      revelations which the magi made to the elect. She beheld not the
      appearance of the blessed spirits, which at the importunity of the
      brothers flitted through the apartment. She heard not Cagliostro take
      leave of Baron von Bischofswerder, when all had withdrawn, saying, &ldquo;I have
      now exalted you to be chief director of the holy order. You will at once
      receive orders from the Invisible Fathers, announced to you in writing,
      and you will follow them faithfully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will follow them faithfully,&rdquo; humbly answered Bischofswerder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be rewarded by the knowledge of life and of money; you shall
      discover the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, and the secret of gold shall be revealed
      to you, when you perform what the Invisible Fathers demand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do every thing,&rdquo; cried Bischofswerder, fervently; &ldquo;only make known
      to me their commands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They desire, at the present, that you seek to be the confidant of the
      Prince of Prussia. Gain his affection, then govern him, making yourself
      indispensable to him. Surround him with servants and confidants that you
      can rely upon. Inspire him with devotion to the holy order. Become, now,
      the friend of the prince, that you may, one day, rule the king. You are
      the chief of the order in Prussia; the more members you gain the more
      secrets will be revealed to you. The holy fathers send me afar, but I
      shall return: if you have been active and faithful, I will make known to
      you a great secret and bring you the elixir of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When will you return, master?&rdquo; asked Bisehofswerder, enthusiastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cagliostro smiled. &ldquo;Before the crown prince of Prussia becomes king. Ask
      no further. Be faithful!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII. THE JESUIT GENERAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      No one remained in the drawing-room but Cagliostro and the beautiful woman
      who still lay quietly on the couch, upon the throne. Cagliostro approached
      her, and, raising the veil, regarded her a moment, with an expression of
      the most passionate tenderness: &ldquo;We are alone, Lorenza,&rdquo; said he. She
      opened her great eyes, and looked around the dimly-lighted room; then,
      fixing them upon Cagliostro, who stood before her in his brilliant costume
      of magician, she burst into a merry laugh, so loud and so irresistible,
      that Cagliostro was seized involuntarily, and joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! was it not heavenly, was it not a glorious comedy, and did I not play
      divinely, Joseph? Was I not bewitching as the goddess of Nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You looked truly like a goddess, Lorenza, and there is nothing more
      beautiful than you, in heaven or upon earth. But come, my enchantress, it
      is time to break up, as we are to set off early to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we now much money? Was the tribute richly paid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we have a hundred louis d&rsquo;ors and a diamond ring from the mistress
      of this house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; cried Lorenza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the ring, Lorenza, but the diamond, so soon as I have a false stone
      set in the ring&mdash;which I must keep as a ring in the chain which will
      bind this woman to our cause.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was I not astonishingly like her? Was it not almost unmistakable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, wonderfully deceptive. I shuddered myself as I saw the dagger
      pointed at your bosom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the blood, how it gushed forth, Joseph!&rdquo; Lorenza burst into a merry
      laugh again, and Cagliostro joined her, but suddenly stopped, and,
      listening, turned toward the door, which he had closed after
      Bischofswerder departed. It seemed as if he heard a noise&mdash;a peculiar
      knocking. Four times it was repeated, and Cagliostro waved his hand to
      Lorenza not to speak. Again were heard the four peculiar rhythmical
      sounds. &ldquo;Be quiet, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake be quiet, Lorenza! Let me cover you
      with the veil; it is a messenger from the Invisibles.&rdquo; Cagliostro flew to
      the door, unbolted it, and stood humbly near the entrance. A masked
      figure, enveloped in a cloak, opened it, and entered, rebolting it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly turning toward Cagliostro, he harshly demanded, &ldquo;Whose servant are
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The servant of the Invisible Rulers and Fathers,&rdquo; he humbly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are the Invisible Fathers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The four ambassadors of the great general of the exiles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call him by that name which he bore before a heretic pope in Rome, a weak
      empress, a free-thinking emperor in Germany, a lost-in-sin French emperor,
      and a heretic Spanish minister, condemned him to banishment and
      destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General of the Jesuits,&rdquo; he answered respectfully, bowing lower.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the sign by which he may be recognized?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by a ring with the likeness of the founder of the order, the holy
      Ignatius Loyola.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then look, and recognize me,&rdquo; cried the mask, extending his hand to
      Cagliostro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The General,&rdquo; he murmured, frightened, gazing at the ring upon the small,
      white hand of the other. &ldquo;The holy founder of the order himself!&rdquo; He
      seized his hand and pressed it to his lips, sinking upon his knees. The
      mask remained standing before the magician, as lowly as he might bow
      himself, who was still arrayed in his brilliant costume with the band upon
      his brow sparkling like diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a cold, reserved manner he answered, &ldquo;I am he, and am come here to
      give you my commands by word of mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Command me; I am thy humble servant, and but a weak tool in thy hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my will that you should become a powerful tool in my hands. Rise,
      for I will speak to the man who must stand erect in the storm. Rise!&rdquo; The
      proud commander was now an humble, obedient servant. He rose slowly,
      standing with bowed head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When and where did we last meet?&rdquo; demanded the mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In 1773, at Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the year of curse and blasphemy,&rdquo; said the mask, in a harsh voice.
      &ldquo;The year in which the infamous Pope Clement XVI. condemned the holy
      order, and hurled his famous bull, Dominus redemptor noster. The holy
      order, condemned and disbanded by his infamous mouth, were changed into
      holy martyrs, without country, without possessions or rights, as
      persecuted fugitives, wandering around the world, to the wicked a scorn,
      to the pious a lamentable example of virtue and constancy. Exiled and
      persecuted, you fled to a house of one of our order, and there we for the
      first time met. The daughter of this man was your beloved. Tell me why did
      you conceal yourself after flying from Palermo? I will see if the elevated
      one ungratefully forgets the days of his degradation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They accused me in Palermo of falsifying documents by which rightful
      owners were deprived of their lawful possessions. They threw me into
      subterranean dungeons, and I was near dying, when the Invisible Protectors
      rescued me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the accusation well founded? Had you committed the crime you were
      accused of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Cagliostro, in a low voice, &ldquo;I was guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For whom, by whose authority?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the pious fathers, who commanded me, and whose pretensions to the
      possessions of the Duc Costa Rica were clearly proved by those documents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You then learned the power and the gratitude of our order. From
      underground prisons they freed you, and procured a way of escape to Rome,
      to find a safe asylum in the house of a believer. But just at that time
      condemnation burst upon us, and from a powerful order we were changed into
      a persecuted one. The forger Joseph Balsamo sought the brazier Feliciano,
      who gave him money, letters of recommendation, and instructed him how to
      serve the order, and procure an agreeable life for himself. Is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; answered Cagliostro, softly. &ldquo;It was the order of the General
      which united you in marriage to your beloved Lorenza Feliciana, who
      initiated you in the secret sciences and the secrets of Nature, that you
      might employ them for the well-being of humanity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so, master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You implored also, as you were about to separate, to see the face of your
      benefactor, to engrave it upon your heart. Would you now be able to
      recognize it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could in an instant, among thousands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The General slowly raised the mask; a pale, emaciated face was visible,
      with great black eyes in sunken sockets, thin bloodless lips, and a high,
      bony brow. &ldquo;Do you recognize me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; sadly answered Cagliostro, &ldquo;it is not the same face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, my son, man changes, but knowledge not. I am another, and yet
      the same, for the outward human form is only the vessel of the eternal
      band into which everlasting truth and the holy doctrines are poured. If
      the vessel breaks, it is replaced by another, and an inexhaustible spring.
      Thought and holy knowledge flow into the renewed vessel. I am a new
      vessel, but the same spirit which formerly spoke to you. I know your past
      life, and for what purpose you are in the world. As the General then spoke
      to you, so speak I now. The unholy have put the holy under a ban&mdash;they
      have persecuted and condemned us. The Holy Order of the Fathers of Jesus
      is lifeless before the world, but not before God. Jesuits do not die, for
      they bear eternal life in them, and there will a day come when they will
      burst forth from darkness into light. Go, my son, and help prepare the
      day, help smooth the way, that we may walk therein. Have you obeyed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have consecrated my whole life to it, your eminence. I have wandered
      around the world, and everywhere striven to disseminate the doctrine of
      the Invisible Fathers, and win disciples and adherents to the order. The
      Brothers of the Egyptian Masons, the Brothers of the Rosicrucians, are the
      disciples which I have won, and you know well there are many mighty and
      illustrious men among them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, and I am satisfied you are an active and useful tool. This I
      came to tell you, that I might stimulate and advise you. Great deeds you
      shall perform, great achievements the holy Ignatius Loyola announces by my
      mouth. The world lies in sin, and the devil strides victorious over it,
      since the holy order has been proscribed and persecuted by the wicked. The
      devil is arrogant progress and boasting reason. They who listen to him
      think themselves wise when they are fools, and speak of their
      enlightenment while they still wander in the dark. To combat this reason,
      to oppose this intelligence, is the task of our order, which will never
      die. For God Sent it forth to the world to fight the devil of progress,
      who is the ruler of darkness. I have observed you, I have followed you,
      and I am satisfied. But I await still greater things from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall it be? Speak, O master; command, and I obey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall strive throughout Europe for the restitution of the holy order.
      You shall subject to it all minds; make the rich, the powerful, the
      eminent and great, serviceable to it. Into the Orders of the Rosicrucians
      and Egyptian Masons you shall gather all the stray and isolated sheep into
      a flock, to await with longing the coming of the shepherd, and prepare a
      place for him. To the holy Church you shall consecrate the band of
      brothers, the only blessed Church, which is the lofty abode of the father
      of our order. To us belongs the world; you shall assist to reconquer it.
      Unbelievers shall be fought with every weapon. Every deception, slander,
      persecution, and murder, are holy if used for the benefit of the holy
      order. You shall shrink from nothing which is useful and beneficial for
      the sublime goal. The murder of a prince is no sin, but a just punishment,
      when it is necessary to remove a mighty enemy. If you create revolutions,
      cause nations to tear each other to pieces in grim civil war, these
      revolutions will be sanctified, the civil wars blessed, if they serve to
      strengthen the power of our order, and gain victory at last against the
      opponents. Only through our order can happiness reenter the world, and
      mankind be rescued. If the Holy Fathers do not sit in the council of
      princes, if they are not the conscience of the powerful, and steer the
      machine of state, the world goes to destruction, and mankind is lost. You
      shall help, my son, to turn aside the evil, and prepare happiness for
      earth. You have already done much, but much more is required. Go and work
      miracles; belief in them sanctifies the mind. Our fathers will sustain you
      everywhere, for you well know they are always present, though it is
      imagined they are not. The infamous Ganganelli has stripped them of their
      uniform, but not annihilated them, as we are, and ever shall be. I have
      sent out nine thousand brothers in Europe for the benefit of the order,
      and you will recognize them by the watchword. They will serve you as you
      will serve them. If danger menaces you, our brothers will know it, and
      rescue you. You will be unassailable, so long as you work for the order,
      and win disciples for it. Prussia is our important station as you rightly
      judged, and I extol you for your foresight. You prepare the future, for
      here it will be! When the royal mocker of religion dies, then comes a new
      kingdom, and the Rosicrucians will rise to power. Vices as well as virtues
      must serve us; therefore Dischofswerder and Wilhelmine Enke are useful
      means for holy purposes. That you have recognized it I praise you.
      Continue, my son, as you have begun, and you shall become powerful upon
      the earth. Not a hair of your head shall be touched so long as you are
      faithful to the Invisible Fathers. But so soon as you turn traitor to the
      holy cause you are lost, and our anger will crush you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never will I turn traitor,&rdquo; cried Cagliostro, holding up his hands as if
      taking an oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not. Our enemies shall be your enemies, and our friends your
      friends. If one of the brothers orders you in my name, &lsquo;Kill this man or
      that woman,&rsquo; so kill them! Swear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shuddering, Cagliostro repeated, &ldquo;I swear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as one of the brothers orders you, in my name, &lsquo;Rescue this man
      or that woman,&rsquo; so do every thing; even risk and sacrifice your life to
      rescue him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You stand in the holy temple of the order, but also under its avenging
      sword. Be mindful of it in all your acts. The world is open to you, and
      our influence will be with you everywhere. You shall win the hearts of the
      great and the mighty to us, and place the Order of the Rosicrucians on the
      steps of the throne. The Great Kophta shall lead believers to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Great Kophta will perform all that you command, as he is only the
      humble servant of his general,&rdquo; said Cagliostro, kissing the hand extended
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not kiss the hand, it is only that of an inferior mortal: kiss the
      ring, for it is the imperishable sign of our immortal saint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I kiss the ring of the immortal Ignatius Loyola, and swear eternal
      fidelity, constant obedience, and firm love, until death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise! for the time has come for us to separate. I have provided for the
      journeys the necessary means. Here are letters of recommendation to Warsaw
      and Mittau, others to Paris and London; but, the most important of all,
      letters of credit upon well-known bankers to the value of five hundred
      thousand dollars&mdash;all valid, though delivered years hence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A half million!&rdquo; cried Cagliostro, almost terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does a half million astonish you?&rdquo; repeated the General, and his gray,
      fleshless face was distorted into a smile. &ldquo;The Great Kophta must travel
      and live like a prince, that he may dazzle the eyes of the brothers, and
      subjugate the minds of the powerful. We give you the money, but remember
      you are always under the watchful eye of the order, and there is no spot
      on earth where you can hide yourself from our vengeance with the trust
      confided in you. You shall spend it to buy souls and win thrones, for
      hearts and consciences are sold; money will buy every thing. Take your
      letters of credit; you shall live as a great lord, and the Great Kophta
      shall be equal with princes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed Cagliostro five sealed letters, saying: &ldquo;They are made out for
      five years; only one for each year, as the number indicates. Number one is
      for this year, and number five is only valid at the expiration of five
      years. The order is mindful of your security, and thus five years of your
      life are freed from earthly care. You shall work in spirit, and you shall
      enchant the world, that it may be saved through the only saving Church,
      and the Holy Order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed a farewell, making the sign of the cross upon Cagliostro, and
      bent his steps to the throne, raising the veil which enveloped Lorenza.
      She looked up to him with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes, smiling. By
      this she would express her thanks for the princely gift to her husband,
      and swear to the General her delight, her fidelity, and love. He regarded
      her as coldly and calmly as a physician a patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, holy father, I have heard all,&rdquo; she said, with a sweet, flute-like
      voice. &ldquo;My heart is filled with gratitude and emotion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prove it by assisting your husband to attain the goal for which we send
      him forth. I have already said that vice must serve virtue, Lorenza.
      Beauty is a power, and if it serves holy purposes, so is it sanctified.
      Employ your beauty to win adherents to the order, and extend the power of
      the Rosicrucians in every land, and among all nations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear that this shall be my holiest endeavor,&rdquo; cried Lorenza, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      The General pressed her back upon the pillow, saying: &ldquo;Remain, for there
      is no one here for you to enchant. I bring you pardon for your sins, and
      an indulgence for every sin which you will commit, if you swear to serve
      faithfully the holy Church and the pious fathers of Jesus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear,&rdquo; solemnly cried Lorenza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is the letter of indulgence from Pius VI. himself, made out in your
      name for you. Take it, and perform your duty.&rdquo; He laid down the parchment
      provided with the papal seal upon her shoulder, and drawing the veil over
      her made the sign of the cross, saying, &ldquo;I bless you, and give you
      absolution for your sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me also, lord and master,&rdquo; cried Cagliostro, kneeling upon the
      lowest step to the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bless you in the name of Loyola. Remain upon your knees, and follow me
      not.&rdquo; He extended his hands over him, and blessed him, then slowly
      withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first beams of the morning sun shone through the great window-panes,
      lighting up with its golden rays Cagliostro&rsquo;s kneeling form. He remained
      with his head bowed until the General had passed out. &ldquo;He is gone; Heaven
      be praised, he is gone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is gone,&rdquo; repeated Lorenza, springing from the couch. &ldquo;Is it
      true, has he given you half a million?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cagliostro held up with triumphant air the letters. &ldquo;See, these addresses
      are upon the first banking-houses in Rome, Paris, London, and Berlin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe that they are genuine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am convinced of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we have attained our aim; we are rich and powerful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Cagliostro, mournfully, &ldquo;we are poorer than ever. This
      money makes us slaves, makes us dependent tools. Did you not hear him say,
      &lsquo;You are admitted into the Temple, but the avenging sword of the order
      everywhere hangs over you.&rsquo;&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII. A PENSIONED GENERAL.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife,&rdquo; cried the General von Werrig, limping around the room, leaning
      upon his crutch, &ldquo;here is the answer from our most gracious lord and king.
      The courier arrived to-day from the war department, and sent it to me by
      an express.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the king&rsquo;s answer?&rdquo; asked the general&rsquo;s wife, a pale, gaunt
      woman, with a pock-marked face, harsh, severe features, dull gray eyes,
      which never beamed with emotion, and thin, bloodless lips, upon which a
      smile never played. &ldquo;What is the king&rsquo;s answer?&rdquo; she repeated, in a rough
      voice, as her husband, puffing and blowing from the effort of walking,
      sank down upon a chair, and dried his fat, ruby face with a red cotton
      pocket-handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not read it,&rdquo; panted the old man. &ldquo;I thought I would leave the
      honor to you, as you, my very learned wife, wrote the letter to his
      majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife was not in the least astonished at this thoughtful conduct of her
      husband. She impetuously seized the sealed document, and, retiring to the
      window-niche, slowly unfolded it, whilst the old general fixed his little
      gray eyes upon her emotionless face. His own was bloated and red,
      expressing the greatest anxiety and expectation. Perfect stillness reigned
      for some minutes, only the regular strokes of the pendulum were heard from
      the clock on the wall; and, as the hands pointed to the expiration of the
      hour, a cuckoo sprang out of the tree painted over the dial, and eleven
      times her hoarse, croaking voice was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It gets every day more out of tune,&rdquo; growled the general, as he looked up
      to the old, yellow dial, and ran his eye over the cords which supported
      the weights. Then glancing around the room, he saw everywhere age, decay,
      and indigence. There was an old divan, with a patched, faded covering of
      silk, and a grandfather&rsquo;s arm-chair near it, the cushion of which the
      general knew, by the long years of experience, to be hard as a stone. A
      round table stood near the divan, covered with a shabby woollen cover, to
      hide the much-thumbed, dull polish. A few cane-chairs against the wall, an
      old black-oak wardrobe near the door, and the sewing-table of Madame von
      Werrig in the window-niche, completed the furniture of the room. At the
      window hung faded woollen curtains, and on the green painted walls some
      pictures and portraits, conspicuous among them a beautiful portrait of the
      king, painted on copper, which represented Frederick in his youthful
      beauty. It was a morose, sullen-looking room, arranged most certainly by
      its feminine occupant, and harmonized exactly with her fretful face and
      angular figure, void of charms. At last the general broke the silence with
      submissive voice: &ldquo;I pray you, Clotilda, tell me what the king wrote.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She folded the paper, joy beaming in her eyes. &ldquo;Granted! every thing
      granted!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general jumped up to embrace his wife with youthful activity, in spite
      of the gout. &ldquo;You are a capital wife,&rdquo; he cried, at the same time giving
      her a loud, smacking kiss upon her cold, gray cheek. &ldquo;It was the
      brightest, cleverest act of my life marrying you, Clotilda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might well say the reverse, Emerentius,&rdquo; she replied, complainingly.
      &ldquo;It surely was not sensible for me, a young lady from such a genteel
      family, and so spoiled, to marry an officer whom the king ennobled upon
      the battle-field, and who possessed nothing but his captain&rsquo;s pay&mdash;a
      fickle man, and a gambler, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Clotilda, love usurped reason,&rdquo; soothingly replied the general;
      &ldquo;love is your excuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; cried Madame von Werrig. &ldquo;Love is never an excuse; it is
      folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us suppose, then, that you did not marry for love, only from
      pure reason, because you found that it was quite time to espouse some one;
      and that, in spite of your many ancestors and genteel family, no other
      chance was offered you, unfortunately no one but this captain, whom the
      king ennobled upon the battle-field of Leuthen on account of his bravery,
      and who was a very handsome, agreeable officer, expecting still further
      promotion. And you were not deceived. I was major, when the Hubertsburger
      treaty put an end to a gay war-life. You will remember I was advanced
      during peace; his majesty did not forget that I cut a way for him through
      the enemy, and he made me lieutenant-colonel and colonel, when I was
      obliged to resign on account of this infamous gout, and then I received
      the title of general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without &lsquo;excellency,&rsquo;&rdquo; replied his wife, dryly. &ldquo;I have not even this
      pleasure to be called &lsquo;excellency.&rsquo; It would have been a slight
      compensation for my sad, miserable existence, and vexed many of the female
      friends of my youth if they had been obliged to call me &lsquo;excellency.&rsquo; But
      my marriage brought me only cares, not even a title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not forget a lovely daughter, Clotilda. Our Marie is beautiful, wise,
      and good, and through her you will yet have tranquil happiness. For you
      say the king has granted all we wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every thing!&rdquo; repeated the wife, with emphasis. &ldquo;We have at last finished
      with want and care, and can count upon an independent, quiet old age, for
      God has been gracious, and forced you, from the gout, to give up gambling,
      and we are freed from the misery which has so often threatened us from
      your unhappy passion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the beginning, I played from passion; afterward, I only played to win
      back what I had lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in that manner played away all we possessed, and played upon your
      word of honor, so that for years the half of our pension went to pay your
      gambling-debts. Heaven be thanked, the king did not know it, or we would
      have experienced still worse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pray you, beloved Clotilda, do not fret yourself needlessly about the
      past; it is all over, and, as you say, I am unfortunately a prisoner in
      the house from the gout, which shields me from the temptation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not say unfortunately; I said &lsquo;Heaven be praised, the gout had put
      an end to your fickle life.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, thank Heaven, my dear; we will not quarrel about it. It is past,
      and, as the king has granted all, we shall have a pleasant life now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will soon receive from our son-in-law a yearly pension, which will be
      paid to me, and I shall spend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general sighed. &ldquo;In that case I fear that I shall not get much of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, more than I have ever received from your pension.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is but one thing wanting,&rdquo; replied the general, evasively, &ldquo;Marie&rsquo;s
      consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madame von Werrig gave a short, gruff laugh, which did not in the least
      brighten her sullen face. &ldquo;We will not ask her consent, but command it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general remarked, timidly, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;Marie had a very
      decided character, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you hesitate to speak out for? What&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she still loves the Conrector Moritz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A second laugh, somewhat menacing, sounded like a challenge. &ldquo;The
      schoolmaster!&rdquo; she cried, contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her dare to tell me again she loves the schoolmaster; she the
      daughter of a general, and a native-born countess of the empire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, it was your fault&mdash;the only fault you ever committed,
      perhaps. How could you let such a young, handsome, and agreeable man come
      to the house as teacher to our daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I suppose my daughter was so degenerated as to love a common
      schoolmaster, and wish to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is truly unheard of, and it would make any one angry, my dear wife,
      for she insists upon loving him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will not insist, she will do what she is commanded to do&mdash;my
      word for it! But why talk about it? It is better to decide the matter at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Frau von Werrig rose with a determined manner, and rang the small brass
      bell which was upon the sofa-table. But a few seconds elapsed before a
      little, crooked servant appeared at the side-door, with her dirty apron
      put aside by tucking the corner in her belt. &ldquo;Go to my daughter, and tell
      her to come down immediately!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant, instead of hastening to obey the order, remained standing
      upon the threshold. &ldquo;I dare not go,&rdquo; said she, in a hoarse, croaking
      voice. &ldquo;Fraulein told me not to disturb her to-day, for she has still two
      bouquets of flowers to arrange, and two lessons to give, and she is so
      busy that she is not at home to visitors. She torments herself from
      morning till night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I order you to tell Fraulein to come down at once; we have something
      important to tell her. No contradiction! go, Trude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant understood the cold, commanding tone of the mother, and dared
      not disobey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing good that they have to tell her,&rdquo; grumbled Trude, as she
      hurried up the stairs which led from the first story into the little, low
      room in the attic, under the sloping roof. Here and there a few tiles
      could be lifted, which lighted the garret sufficiently to show the door at
      the end. &ldquo;May I come in, my dear Fraulein? it is Trude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door is open,&rdquo; cried a sweet voice, and Trude entered. It is a most
      charming little room, just that of a young girl. The bed has a snow-white
      covering, and white curtains, suspended from a hook in the wall around it.
      The same curtains at the low gable-windows, whose depth, so to speak, made
      a light anteroom to the real gloomy one in the background. In this little
      anteroom the young girl had placed all that was necessary for her pleasure
      and use. There were the most beautiful, sweet-scented flowers upon the
      window-stool; in a pretty metal cage was a light-colored canary. There
      were also pretty engravings, and upon the table stood a vase filled with
      superb artificial flowers, and before it sat the possessor of this room,
      the daughter of General and Frau von Werrig, surrounded with her
      work-tools, paper, and colored materials&mdash;a young girl, scarcely
      twenty, of a proud, dignified appearance, but simply and gracefully
      dressed. According to the fashion of the day, her hair was slightly
      powdered, and raised high above her broad, clear brow with a blue rosette,
      and ends at the side. The nobly-formed and beautiful face was slightly
      flushed, and around the month was an expression of courageous energy. As
      old Trude entered, the young girl raised her eyes from the rose-bud which
      she was just finishing, and looked at her. What beautiful black eyes they
      were as they sparkled underneath the delicately-arched, black eyebrows!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, old one,&rdquo; said she, kindly, &ldquo;what do you wish? Did you forget that I
      wanted to work undisturbed to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t forget it, my Fraulein, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have forgotten that up here, in my attic-room, I am not your
      Fraulein, but your Marie, whom you have taken care of and watched over
      when a child, and whose best and truest friend you have been. Come, give
      me your hand, and tell me what you have to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Trude shuffled hurriedly along in her leather slippers. Her old,
      homely face looked almost attractive, with its expression of glowing
      tenderness, as she regarded the beautiful, smiling face before her, and
      laid her hard brown hand in the little white one extended to her. &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo;
       she said, softly and anxiously, &ldquo;you must go down at once to your mother
      and father. They have something very important to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something very important!&rdquo; repeated Marie, laying aside her work. &ldquo;Do you
      know what it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing good, I fear,&rdquo; sighed the old woman. &ldquo;A soldier has been here
      from the war department and brought a letter for the general, and he told
      me that it was sent from the king&rsquo;s cabinet at Breslau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Heaven! what does it mean?&rdquo; cried Marie, frightened, and springing
      up. &ldquo;Something is going to happen, I know. I have noticed certain
      expressions which escaped my father; the proud, threatening manner of my
      mother; but above all the bold importunity of that man, whom I despise as
      one detests vice, stupidity, and ennui. They will not believe that I hate
      him, that I rather&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie, are you not coming?&rdquo; called the mother, with a commanding voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must obey,&rdquo; she said, drawing a long breath, and hastening to the door,
      followed by Trude, who pulled her back and held her fast upon the very
      first step. &ldquo;You have forbidden me to speak of him, but I must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie stood as if rooted to the spot, her face flushed, and in breathless
      expectation looking back to old Trude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, Trude,&rdquo; she softly murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie, I saw him to-day, an hour ago!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, Trude, where did you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over on the corner of Frederick Street, by the baker&rsquo;s. He stood waiting
      for me, as he knows I always go there. He had been there two hours, and
      feared that I was not coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say? Quick! what did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said that he was coming to see you to-day at twelve o&rsquo;clock; that he
      would rather die than live in this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day? and you have just told me of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not mean to say any thing at all about it; I thought it would be
      better, and then you would not have to dissemble. But now, if any harm
      comes to you, you know he is coming, and will stand by you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will stand by me&mdash;yes, he will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie!&rdquo; cried her mother, and her dry, gaunt figure appeared at the foot
      of the stairs. Marie flew down to the sitting-room of her parents,
      following her mother, who took her place in the niche at the open window
      without speaking to her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. THE KING&rsquo;S LETTER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; said the general&rsquo;s wife, after seating herself upon the hard
      cushion of the divan, near which sat the general in his arm-chair, busily
      stroking his painful right leg&mdash;&ldquo;Marie, take a chair, and sit near
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie noiselessly brought a cane-chair, and seated herself by the table,
      opposite her parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have just received a communication from the king&rsquo;s cabinet,&rdquo; said the
      mother, solemnly. &ldquo;It is necessary that you should know the contents, and
      I will read it aloud to you. I expressly forbid you, however, to interrupt
      me while I am reading, in your impetuous manner, with your remarks, which
      are always of the most obstinate and disagreeable kind. You understand, do
      you, Marie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly, mother; I will listen without interrupting you, according to
      your command.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This communication is naturally addressed to your father, as I wrote to
      the king in his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not know that you had written to his majesty at all, dear mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother cast a furious glance at the gentle, decided face of her
      daughter. &ldquo;You already forget my command and your promise to listen
      without interrupting me. I did, indeed, write to his majesty, but it is
      not necessary to tell you what I, or rather your father, solicited, as you
      will hear it in the answer from our most gracious king. It runs thus: &lsquo;My
      faithful subject: I have received your petition, and I was glad to learn
      by this occasion that you are well, and that you now lead a steady,
      reasonable life. Formerly you gave good cause of complaint; for it is well
      known to me that you led a dissolute life, and your family suffered want
      and misfortune from your abominable chance-games. You know that I have
      twice paid your debts; that at the second time I gave you my royal word of
      assurance that I would never pay a groschen for you again. If you gave
      yourself up to the vice, and made gambling-debts, I would send you to the
      fortress at Spandau, and deprive you of your pension. Nevertheless you
      played again, and commenced your vicious life anew. Notwithstanding which,
      I did not send you to prison as I threatened, and as you deserved, because
      I remembered that you had been a brave soldier, and did me a good service
      at the battle of Leuthen. For this reason I now also grant your request,
      that, as you have no son, your name and coat-of-arms may descend to your
      son-in-law. The name of Werrig-Leuthen is well worthy to be preserved, and
      be an example to succeeding generations. I give my permission for Ludwig
      Ebenstreit, banker, to marry your daughter and only child, and&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie uttered a cry of horror, and sprang from her seat. &ldquo;Mother!&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be still! I commanded you not to interrupt me, but listen, with becoming
      respect, to the end, to the words&rsquo; of his majesty.&rdquo; And, with a louder
      voice, occasionally casting a severe, commanding glance at her daughter,
      she read on: &ldquo;&lsquo;And call himself in future Ludwig Werrig von Leuthen. I
      wish that he should honor the new name, and prove himself a true nobleman.
      Ludwig Ebenstreit must give up, or sell, without delay, his banking
      business, as I cannot permit a nobleman to continue the business of
      citizen, and remain a merchant. A nobleman must either be a soldier or a
      landed proprietor; and if your future son-in-law will not be either, he
      can live upon his income, which must indeed be ample. But I command him to
      spend it in the country, not go to foreign countries to spend what he has
      gained in the country. If he should do it, it will not be well with him,
      and he shall be brought back by force. You may communicate this to him,
      and he can judge for himself. I will have the letters of nobility made out
      for him, for which he shall pay the sum of one hundred louis d&rsquo;ors to the
      &lsquo;Invalids&rsquo; at Berlin. It depends upon him whether as a true nobleman he
      will not give my poor &lsquo;Invalids&rsquo; a greater sum. The marriage shall not
      take place until the letters of nobility have been published in the Berlin
      journals, for I do not wish the daughter of a general, and a countess, to
      marry beneath her. You can prepare every thing for the wedding, and let
      them be married as soon as publication has been made. I will give the
      bride a thousand thalers for a dowry, that she may not go to her rich
      husband penniless; the money will be paid to your daughter from the
      government treasury at her receipt. As ever I remain your well-disposed
      king, FREDERICK.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here on the margin,&rdquo; continued the general&rsquo;s wife, looking over to
      her husband with malicious pleasure, &ldquo;the king has written a few lines in
      his own hand: &lsquo;I have given orders that the money shall be paid to your
      daughter in person, with her receipt for the same, for I know you, and
      know that you do not play, not because you have not the money, but the
      gout. If you had the cash and not the gout, you would play your daughter&rsquo;s
      dowry to the devil, and that I do not wish, for a noble maiden should not
      marry a rich husband as poor as a church mouse. FREDERICK.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A profound stillness prevailed when the reading was finished. The general
      busied himself, as usual, rubbing his gouty leg with the palm of his hand.
      Marie sat with her hands pressed upon her bosom, as if she would force
      back the sighs and sobs which would break forth. Her great, black eyes
      were turned to her mother with an expression of painful terror, and she
      searched with a deathly anxiety for a trace of sympathy and mercy upon her
      cold, immovable face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother slowly folded the letter, and laid it upon the table. &ldquo;You know
      all now, Marie&mdash;that, as it becomes parents, we have disposed of your
      future and your hand. You will submit to their wishes without murmuring or
      opposition, as it becomes an obedient, well-brought-up daughter, and
      receive the husband we have chosen for you. He will come today to hear
      your consent, and you from this day forth are the betrothed of the future
      Herr von Werrig. Of course from this very hour you will cease the highly
      improper and ungenteel business which you have pursued. You must not make
      any more flowers, or give any more lessons. The time of such degradation
      and humiliation is past, and my daughter can no longer be a
      school-mistress. You have only to write the receipt to-day, and I will go
      with you to the treasury to get the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not write the receipt,&rdquo; said Marie, gently but firmly. Her mother,
      in the act of rising, sank back upon the divan; and the general,
      apparently quite occupied with his leg, stopped rubbing, and raised his
      red, bloated face to his daughter in astonishment. &ldquo;Did I understand
      rightly your words, that you would not write the receipt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother, I said so; I cannot and will not write it,&rdquo; replied Marie,
      gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why cannot you, and will you not write it?&rdquo; said her mother,
      scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I have no right to the money, and cannot take it, mother, as I
      will never be the wife of the man you intend me to marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general sprang with a savage curse from his arm-chair, and would have
      rushed to his daughter, but his wife pushed him back into his seat, and
      approached Marie, who rose, regarding her mother with a firm, sad
      expression. &ldquo;Why can you not be the wife of the man we have chosen for
      you? Answer me, WHY you cannot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, mother,&rdquo; she replied, and gradually her voice assumed a more
      decided tone, her cheeks reddened, and an inspired expression beamed from
      her eyes, and pervaded her whole being&mdash;&ldquo;you know, mother, that I can
      never be the wife of Herr Ebenstreit, for I do not love him. I despise and
      abominate him, because he is a man without honor; he knows that I do not
      love him, and yet he insists upon marrying me. If it were not so, if I did
      not despise and abominate him, I would not receive his suit and marry
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; cried the general, shaking his fist at his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; cried the mother, with a cold, icy glance, void of pity or
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie encountered these looks with beaming eyes. &ldquo;Because I am betrothed
      to another,&rdquo; and the words came like a cry of joy from her heart&mdash;&ldquo;because
      I am engaged to my beloved Moritz!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shameless, obstinate creature, have we not forbidden it?&rdquo; cried her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; interrupted his wife, with a commanding wave of her hand, which
      silenced the obedient husband immediately. &ldquo;It belongs to me to question
      her, for I am her mother, and my daughter owes me submission and obedience
      above all things.&mdash;Answer me, Marie, did you not know that we had
      forbidden you to speak to this man, or have any communication with him?
      Did you not know that I, your mother, had menaced you with a curse if you
      married this man, or even spoke to the miserable, pitiable creature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; cried Marie, vehemently, &ldquo;he is not a poor, miserable creature.
      You may hate him, but you dare not outrage the noble, the good, and just
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a good-for-nothing fellow,&rdquo; cried her father; &ldquo;he has tried to win
      a minor behind the parents&rsquo; back. He is a shameful, good-for-nothing
      seducer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dishonorable,&rdquo; cried the general&rsquo;s wife&mdash;&ldquo;a dishonorable man,
      who has misused our confidence. We confided to him our daughter to teach,
      and paid him for it. He improved the opportunity to make a declaration of
      love, and stole the time from us to infatuate the heart of our daughter
      with flattery, and from his pupil win a bride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, unworthy, shameful slander!&rdquo; cried Marie, her eyes flashing with
      anger. &ldquo;You well know that it is a vile scandal, that Moritz was no paid
      teacher. If he had been&mdash;if he had felt obliged to yield to the sad
      necessity of being paid for his valuable time, because he was poor, and
      forced to live by his intellect, he was a free man, and had the right to
      love whom he chose. He loves me, and I have accepted his love as the most
      precious, most beautiful, and most glorious gift of my life. Ah! do not
      look so angry with me, father; I cannot say otherwise. I cannot crush or
      deny the inmost life of my life.&mdash;Oh, mother, forgive me that I
      cannot change it! You know that otherwise I have been a most obedient
      daughter to you in all things, although you have never taught me the
      happiness of possessing a loving mother; though neither of you could ever
      forgive your only child for not being a son, who could inherit your name,
      and win a brilliant position, yet I have always loved you tenderly and
      truly, and never complained that the unwelcome daughter received neither
      love nor tenderness, only indifference and coldness from her parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beautiful, very beautiful!&rdquo; replied the mother, contemptuously. &ldquo;Now you
      wish to blame us that you are a heartless and thankless daughter.&mdash;We
      have not understood her heart, and it is our fault that her love has flown
      somewhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the language of romance. I have, indeed, read it in the romances
      of Herr Moritz, and my daughter has only repeated what she learned as a
      docile pupil from her schoolmaster. Very fine, to pay Herr Moritz to form
      our daughter into the heroine of a romance! She ought to have learned the
      languages, but has learned only the language of romances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very severe and very cruel, mother,&rdquo; said Marie, sadly. &ldquo;I would
      not complain, only excuse myself, and implore pity and indulgence, and
      defend myself from the reproach of having been a cold, unloving daughter.
      Oh! God knows how I have longed for your love; that I would willingly
      prove that I would joyfully do every thing to embellish your life and make
      you happy. It gave me such pleasure to earn something for you with my dear
      flowers and lessons, and afford you a little gratification!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! now, she will reproach us with having toiled for us and sacrificed
      herself. Husband, thank yourself for the victim who worked for you, who
      gave her youth for us that she might strew our life with roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have had enough of this talking and whining,&rdquo; cried the general,
      furiously beating the table with his fist. &ldquo;My daughter shall not be a
      heroine of romance, but an obedient child, who submits to the will of her
      parents. You shall marry the man that we have chosen for you; the king has
      given his consent, and it shall take place. I command you! That is
      sufficient! I will hear no more about it; the thing is done with. Herr
      Ebenstreit is coming this afternoon to make you a proposal of marriage
      with our consent, and you must, accept him. I command you to do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot obey you! Oh, do not force me to rebel against God&rsquo;s holy laws!
      Have pity upon me! I have obeyed you until now, and yielded to your
      wishes, although I thought it would break my heart sometimes. You have
      forbidden Moritz the house, and turned him out of doors like a servant,
      with scorn and contempt, and he has silently borne it on my account. You
      have forbidden me to write or receive letters from him, or ever to meet
      him. My mother would curse me if I disobeyed her, and I submitted. I have
      given up every thing, sacrificed every wish, and renounced my love. But
      you cannot expect more from me, or dare ask it. I can forego happiness,
      but you cannot ask me to consent to be buried alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what if we should wish it?&rdquo; asked her mother. &ldquo;If we should demand
      our daughter to give up a romantic, foolish love, to become the wife of a
      young man who loves her, and who loves us, and who is rich enough to
      assure us a comfortable old age, free from care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; cried the general, in a begging and almost imploring tone,
      &ldquo;Marie, prove to us now that you are really a good and grateful child&mdash;we
      have had so much care and want in our life, so many sorrowful days! It
      lies in your hands to make our declining days joyous and bright, and free
      us from want. We have often grumbled against God, that He did not give us
      a son; now make us to rejoice that He has given us a daughter, who will
      bring us a son and inherit our name through her children, and who will
      give us what we have never known&mdash;prosperity and riches. I beg you,
      my dear, good child, grant your parents the few last years of their life
      freedom from care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, Marie,&rdquo; said her mother, in a softened and tender tone, which
      Marie had never heard from her&mdash;&ldquo;I beg you also, be a good daughter,
      pity your mother! I have always led a joyless, unhappy life. I lived
      unmarried, a native-born countess, with proud relations, who made me feel
      bitterly my dependence; when married my existence was only trouble,
      privations, care, and sorrow. I beg you, Marie, teach me to know
      happiness, for which I have so longed in vain; give me independence and
      prosperity, which I have always desired, and never known. I pray, Marie,
      make us happy in bringing us a rich, genteel, and good son-in-law, Herr
      Ebenstreit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie, who met the scorn and threats of her mother with firmness and a
      proud demeanor, trembled as she heard these severe and merciless lips,
      always so cold and harsh, now begging and imploring. At first she was
      quite frightened, and then terrified, and covered her face with her hands,
      her head sinking upon her breast as her mother spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, my daughter,&rdquo; cried the general, as his wife was silent. &ldquo;Speak,
      my dear Marie. Say the word, and we shall be all happy, and there will be
      no happier family found in Berlin, or the world even. Say that you will
      marry Ebenstreit, and we will love and bless you so long as we live. Do
      say yes, dear Marie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her hands fell from her face, and stretching them out toward her parents,
      she looked at them in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a fearful pause. &ldquo;I cannot, it is impossible!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;I
      cannot marry this man, for I do not love him. I love another, whom I can
      never forget, whom I shall love forever. I love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herr Conrector Moritz!&rdquo; announced Trude, hastily bursting open the door,
      and looking in with a triumphant smile.

      CHAPTER XV. HATE AND LOVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herr Conrector Moritz wishes to pay his respects,&rdquo; called out Trude
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not wish to receive him,&rdquo; cried Frau von Werrig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He dare not presume to enter!&rdquo; shrieked the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie cried, &ldquo;Moritz! Oh! my beloved Moritz,&rdquo; rushing with outstretched
      arms toward her lover, who just appeared at the door. &ldquo;God has sent you to
      sustain me in this fearful hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Trude peeped through the half-closed door, well satisfied to see her
      dear young lady folded in Moritz&rsquo;s arms, and her head leaning upon his
      shoulder. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured, closing softly the door, &ldquo;Marie is right,
      God himself sent her lover in this hour, and I would not let her wicked,
      hard-hearted parents send him away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quick as thought she turned the key, fastening the door, and betook
      herself to the farthest room, carefully closing every door between them.
      &ldquo;Now we will see for once whether they will show him the door, and pitch
      him out. No, they will be obliged to listen to him. Old Trude wishes it,
      for it will make her dear Marie happy. It is all the same to me if the old
      German tries to scratch my eyes out for it; I will take good care to keep
      out of his way. I must go and listen once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put her ear to the keyhole, and then her eye, to see how the
      quarrellers looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the general and his wife were quite alarmed, and almost
      speechless as they witnessed the joyful meeting of the lovers. The father
      sprang up suddenly, with clinched fist, but instead of bitter invectives
      only a fearful shriek of pain was heard, as he sank groaning and
      whimpering into his armchair. The gout had again seized its victim. Anger
      had excited the general&rsquo;s blood, and had also brought on the pain in his
      leg again. His wife took no notice of his cries and groans, for it was
      quite as agreeable to her to be the only speaker, and have her moaning
      husband a kind of assenting chorus. &ldquo;Leave each other!&rdquo; she commanded, as
      she approached the lovers, flourishing her long shrivelled arms about.
      &ldquo;Leave each other, and leave my house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laying her hand on Marie&rsquo;s arm, which was thrown around her lover&rsquo;s neck,
      she endeavored to tear her away, and draw her daughter toward herself. But
      Marie clung only the more firmly, and Moritz pressed her more fervently to
      his heart. They heeded not and heard not the outburst of anger which the
      mother gave way to. They read in each other&rsquo;s eyes the bliss, the joy of
      meeting again, and the assurance of constant, imperishable love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are pale and thin, my beloved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorrow for you is consuming me, Marie, but, thank Heaven, you are
      unchanged, and beautiful as ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hope and love have consoled and strengthened me, Philip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough! I forbid you to speak another word to each other,&rdquo; and with the
      power which rage lends, the mother tore Marie away. &ldquo;Herr Moritz, will you
      tell me by what right you force yourself into our house, and surprise us
      like a street-thief in our peaceful dwelling? But no! you need not tell
      me, I will not listen to you. Those who permit themselves to enter our
      room unasked and unwelcomed&mdash;I will have nothing to say to them.
      Leave! there is the door! Out with you, off the threshold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With calm demeanor, Moritz now approached Fran von Werrig, demanding her
      pardon, saying: &ldquo;You see, madame, that I am not so unwelcome here,
      therefore you will be obliged to let me remain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that she will,&rdquo; sneered Trude, outside the door. &ldquo;It will be
      difficult for her to send him off so long as I am unwilling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will not permit it. We have nothing to do with each other. Out of
      my sight!&mdash;Away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away!&rdquo; cried the general. &ldquo;Oh, the gout, the maddening pains! I cannot
      throw the bold fellow out of the house! I must lie here, and writhe like a
      worm! I cannot be master of my house. Oh, oh! what pain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay, Philip,&rdquo; whispered Marie, as she again leaned toward Moritz. &ldquo;They
      wish to sell me and force me to a hated marriage. Do not yield! save me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mine, Marie; you have sworn to me eternal constancy, and no one
      can compel you to marry if you do not wish to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are her parents; we can, and we will compel her,&rdquo; triumphantly cried
      Frau von Werrig. &ldquo;The king has given his consent, and if it is necessary
      we will drag her to the altar by force!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it, mother, and I will say no before all the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will take care that no one hears you but the priest, and he will not
      listen, as he knows that the king has commanded you to say yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But God will hear her, Frau von Werrig, and He will take vengeance on the
      cruel, heartless mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will await this vengeance,&rdquo; she sneered. &ldquo;It does not concern you, and
      you need not trouble yourself about it. Leave the house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came here to speak with you, and I will not go away until you have
      listened to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will leave, for I will not hear you, and I command you to follow
      me, Marie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seized Marie with irresistible force, and drew her toward the side
      door, which was fast. Then hurried toward the entrance, dragging her
      daughter after her, but shook it in vain; that door was fastened also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I could kiss myself,&rdquo; murmured Trude, as she patted her old, wrinkled
      cheeks. &ldquo;I was as cunning and wise as Solomon. There, shriek for Trude,
      order her to open it. Trude is not there, and she has no ears for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a plot&mdash;a shameful plot!&rdquo; cried Frau von Werrig, stamping
      her feet. &ldquo;That good-for-nothing creature, Trude, is in it. She has locked
      the doors, and the schoolmaster paid her for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trude shook her fist at her mistress behind the door. &ldquo;Wait! that
      good-for-nothing creature will punish you! You shall have something to be
      angry about with me every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear to you that I do not know who locked the doors,&rdquo; replied Moritz,
      calmly. &ldquo;But whoever did it, I thank them from the depths of my soul, for
      it forces you to listen to me, and may love give my words the power to
      soften your heart. General and Frau von Werrig, I conjure you to have
      compassion upon us. Is it possible that you are deaf to the cry of grief
      of your own child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly assuming a contemptuous calm, Frau von Werrig sank back upon the
      divan with great dignity. &ldquo;As I am obliged to listen to you, through a
      shameful deception, let it be so. Try to make ears in my heart, which you
      say is deaf. Let me listen to your wonderful eloquence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Philip!&rdquo; said Marie, clasping his arms, &ldquo;you see it will all be in
      vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me hope to succeed in awakening a spark of loving mercy, as Moses
      caused the fountain to gush from the rock.&mdash;A year since you turned
      me insultingly from your door, Frau von Werrig, and you forbade me with
      scorn and contempt to ever cross your threshold. In the rebellious pride
      of my heart I swore never to do it again, never to speak to those who had
      so injured me. The holy, pure love which binds me to this dear girl has
      released me from my oath. We have tried to live separated from each other
      a long year, an inconsolable, unhappy year! We hoped to renounce each
      other, although we could not forget. Marie, as an obedient daughter,
      obeyed your commands, and returned the ring, which I gave her in a moment
      of affection and holy trust. I released her from the oath of constancy,
      and made her free! But it is in vain! During this year I have striven with
      sorrow as a man, helpless in a desert, who writhes in the folds of the
      poisonous serpent. I should have gone mad if a consoling word from a great
      and noble mind had not roused me from my desolation, and if love had not
      shed a ray of light into my benighted soul. I listened no longer to
      sickening pride and humbled sense of honor. Love commanded me to come
      here, and I came to ask you, Marie, in the presence of your parents, if
      you will be my wife; if you will accept my poor, insignificant name, and
      be contented by my side to lead a quiet, modest existence. I can only earn
      sufficient to assure us a peaceful life. I have no splendor, no treasures
      to offer you, but only my love, my heart, my life, my whole thought and
      being. Will you accept it, Marie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do accept it, Moritz, as the greatest happiness of my life. I desire
      only your love, and I can return only my love to you! Here is my hand,
      Philip, it belongs to you alone! Let us kneel in humility before my
      parents, and implore their blessing.&mdash;Oh, my father and mother, have
      pity upon us! See this dear man, to whom my whole heart belongs. I desire
      only to live and toil with him. There are no riches, no treasures, to
      compare with his love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General and Frau von Werrig, grant me the wife of my heart!&rdquo; cried Philip
      Moritz, deeply moved. &ldquo;It is true, I am not worthy of her, I have no name,
      no position, to offer her, but I swear to strive to gain it for her. I
      will win by my talents and knowledge a distinguished name, and perhaps one
      day you will concede to my fame that I am a noble man, though not a
      nobleman. Will you separate two hearts which belong to each other? Take me
      for your son-in-law, and I swear to be devoted and faithful, to love and
      honor you for your daughter&rsquo;s sake. I can say no more&mdash;words cannot
      express all that I feel. Love causes me to kneel before you, love makes me
      humble as a child. I implore you to give me your daughter in marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I also implore you,&rdquo; cried Marie, sinking down beside Moritz, &ldquo;give to me
      this man, whom I love and honor, for my husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful and impressive scene&mdash;these two young beings
      pleading for happiness; their eyes flashing with the inspiration of
      feeling, conscious that they were one in affection, and ready to combat
      the whole world for each other. But Frau von Werrig was immovable, and the
      general was too much occupied with his gouty, throbbing leg even to cast a
      look upon the beautiful group of youth, love, manly determination, and
      tender resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the door, Trude knelt imploringly, with folded hands, while the
      tears ran down her old cheeks in big drops. &ldquo;O God, I well know that they
      have no pity; have mercy Thou, and cause my dear Marie to be happy! Suffer
      not that that hard-hearted woman should sell her, and marry her to that
      bad man my Marie despises. I well know that I am a poor creature, and not
      worthy that Thou shouldst listen to me, O Lord! But I love that young girl
      as if she were my own child, and I would give my heart&rsquo;s blood for her.
      Oh, my God! I implore Thee to let my Marie be happy!&rdquo; Then she continued,
      as she rose from her knees. &ldquo;Now, I have spoken, and I commit every thing
      to God, and He will do what is best. She has been obliged to listen to
      him, and if it cannot be otherwise, he must go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carefully old Trude unlocked both doors, and then stopped to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trude was right, there was no mercy in Frau von Werrig&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Have you
      finished? Have you any thing more to say?&rdquo; she asked, in her most
      unsympathizing manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more with our lips, but our hearts still implore you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand this language, sir, and you have not succeeded in
      giving me hearing, or ears to hear with. In this useless strife I will say
      a last word, which I hope will be for life. You shall never be the husband
      of my daughter! You can never be united.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie and Moritz sprang from their knees, laying their hands in each
      other&rsquo;s, and looked what words could not have better expressed&mdash;&ldquo;We
      are inseparable, nothing can disunite us but death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I desire you not to interrupt me,&rdquo; commanded Frau von Werrig; &ldquo;I have
      listened to you, and now you shall listen to me. I promise you to speak
      with more brevity than you have. I will not trouble you with useless
      phrases and tedious lamentations. I will speak to the point. Marie is the
      daughter of General Werrig von Leuthen, whose name would become extinct if
      the grace and favor of the king had not prevented it, by permitting the
      husband whom we have chosen for our daughter to take our name, and
      therewith become our son. You may think, in your arrogance of commoner,
      and the pride you take in having won the love of the daughter of General
      von Leuthen, that you could be this husband and son-in-law. But two things
      fail you: first, the necessary fortune; and, secondly, the king&rsquo;s consent,
      and that of her father. If you were rich, it might be possible that we
      should be touched by the tender amorousness of our daughter, and conquer
      our aversion to you for her sake. You are of low birth, and take a
      subordinate position in society. It would be extremely laughable for the
      schoolmaster Moritz to change suddenly into a Herr von Werrig Leuthen. Our
      son-in-law must be a rich man, in order to be able to give his new title
      consideration; and, fortunately, the wooer of my daughter&rsquo;s hand possesses
      this qualification, and therefore we have given our consent. The king has
      approved our choice, and permits the rich banker Ludwig Ebenstreit to
      become our son-in-law, and take our name. The king has in this
      communication, which lies upon the table, and which Marie has heard read,
      given his assurance to ennoble Ebenstreit upon two conditions: first, that
      the banker should give up his business, and live upon his income; and,
      secondly, that the marriage should not take place until the papers of
      nobility are made out and published, so that the daughter of General von
      Werrig should not make a misalliance. You know all now, and you will at
      last understand that there is but one thing for you to do&mdash;conquer
      your foolish presumption, and beg to be excused for your unheard-of
      boldness in forcing yourself into our house, and then withdraw quickly. If
      my ear does not deceive me, your accomplice has opened the doors. I think
      I heard rightly, if my heart has no ears, my head possesses better. We
      have finished. I would again enjoin upon you the duty of begging for
      pardon, and then I close this unrefreshing scene with the same words with
      which it opened&mdash;there is the door&mdash;go out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is the door&mdash;go out of it! I want to be quiet&mdash;go!
      My daughter is the betrothed of the rich banker Herr Ebenstreit; she will
      be his wife as soon as the papers are made out and published.&mdash;Go!&rdquo;
       cried the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young couple still stood there, hand in hand, looking at the general,
      until now their eyes met, beaming with tenderest affection for each other.
      &ldquo;Is it true, Marie? Speak, my beloved, is it true, will you be the wife of
      this rich man whom your parents have chosen for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Philip,&rdquo; she calmly and firmly replied. &ldquo;No, I will not, for I do not
      love him, I love only you; and here, in the presence of God and my
      parents, I swear to you that I will be constant to death! They can prevent
      my becoming your wife, but they cannot force me to wed another. I swear,
      then, that if I cannot be yours, I will never marry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I receive your oath, and God has heard it also!&rdquo; said Moritz, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have also heard it, and I tell you,&rdquo; said Frau von Werrig, &ldquo;that this
      romantic heroine will become a perjurer, for I will find means to make her
      break her silly oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will, perhaps, find means to delay the marriage,&rdquo; said Moritz proudly,
      &ldquo;or, much more, prevent the marriage ceremony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very curious to know the means,&rdquo; said Frau von Werrig. &ldquo;From this
      hour Marie is the betrothed of Herr Ebenstreit, and the wedding will take
      place so soon&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So soon as the title of nobility is published. That is it, is the clause
      to be filled; and therefore I tell you, beloved, wait and hope! This woman
      is without pity and without mercy; but God is in heaven, and Frederick the
      Great on the earth. Wait and hope. Be firm in hope, and constant in love.
      Do not lose courage, and let them force you to compliance by threats and
      anger. I have only you to confide in and to love in the world, and you are
      my hope, my goal, and the happiness of my life. If you forsake me, I lose
      my good angel, and am a lost, miserable man, whom it would be better to
      hurl into the deepest abyss than let him suffer the torments of hated
      existence. The knowledge of your love gives me strength and courage; it
      will inspire me to fight like a hero, to win the dear, beloved wife, to
      whom I would yield my life in order to receive it anew from her purified
      and sanctified. The knowledge that I had lost you, would ruin me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Laying both hands upon his shoulder, Marie looked at him with eyes beaming
      with affection, renewing her vow that she would never love or marry
      another. &ldquo;We will be courageous in hope, and brave in constancy. Listen to
      me, my beloved; listen, my mother&mdash;I betrothed myself to this dear
      man! You can prevent my becoming his wife now, but in four years I am of
      age, and then I shall be my own mistress. Then, my dear Philip, I will be
      your wife. Let us wait and hope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Marie, we will wait and hope.&mdash;Farewell! Do not forget that
      there is a great God in heaven, and a great king upon earth.&mdash;Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pressed the hand clasped in his own passionately to his tips, and felt
      from the pressure of her delicate fingers a renewed vow of constancy.
      Buoyed with this hope in the sad hour of parting, they were happy and
      joyful. Marie accompanied him to the door&mdash;still hand in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presume not to go a step farther,&rdquo; commanded her mother, and Marie,
      obedient to her wishes, remained near the door, bowed to Moritz, and never
      ceased to regard him, with love beaming in her eyes, until the door
      closed. Outside stood old Trude, to tell him that she would be at the
      baker&rsquo;s at seven o&rsquo;clock every morning, and wait for his commissions, &ldquo;and
      may be I shall have something to bring you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;So do come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, my good Trude; you are the only person who is friendly to us.
      Watch over my angel, console her with your affection, and when they are
      too hard upon her, come to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surely will, but listen&mdash;they are already quarrelling with my good
      angel. I will go in, to serve as a lightning-rod for dear Marie. I often
      do it, and it pleases me when the lightning strikes, and dashes my hard
      old head to the ground, but does not hurt me at all&mdash;Farewell, Herr
      Moritz, the lightning-rod must go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trude entered suddenly and noiselessly the sitting-room, and interrupted
      the angry reproaches which Frau von Werrig hurled against Marie in a
      furious stream of words. The countess&rsquo;s rage turned against Trude, who
      stared as if to challenge her. &ldquo;What do you want? How dare you enter
      uncalled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were calling deaf old Trude, or why did you scream so?&rdquo;
       replied Trude, tartly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it was the general. Ah! there lies the poor, dear old man,
      groaning and crying, and nobody has any pity for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Trude, it is good luck that you are here,&rdquo; whined the general. &ldquo;No
      one troubles himself about me. Quick, bring warm covering for my leg, the
      pain is fearful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor, dear father, I will take care of you, I will nurse you,&rdquo; said
      Marie, hastening to him. Her mother pushed her back violently. &ldquo;Not a step
      farther; you have no right to go near him, you are his murderess. On your
      head will fall the guilt, if these dreadful scenes should cause his
      death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, the general will not die quite yet,&rdquo; said Trude busying herself
      about his arm-chair. &ldquo;But, Fraulein, you have got something else to do
      than stay here. They have already sent for the flowers twice, and the
      French lady is waiting up-stairs to parlez-vous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie looked her friendly thanks, and quietly and quickly left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, bold woman, I have a last word to say to you. Who locked the door
      when that creature came?&rdquo; &ldquo;I, madame,&rdquo; answered Trude, who was just
      bringing a great cushion from the back-room to cover the general&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You acknowledge that you locked the door intentionally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, my dear, good Frau von Werrig, one does not lock a door by mistake.
      I did not want Herr Moritz to run away with fright, before you had given
      him your mind, and set his head straight. He would certainly have escaped,
      and only heard the half of your beautiful talk, for he had no idea what a
      miserable fellow he is. So I locked both doors, and he was obliged to
      listen to you, and has gone away contrite and repentant. There, there, my
      poor, dear general, is your foot high enough? Shall I not bring the
      foot-warmer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall not bring any thing, nor do any thing more. You are a
      hypocrite, who connives with Moritz. Leave my house this very hour! You
      are dismissed my service. Go pack up your things and be off!&rdquo; cried Frau
      von Werrig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do not go, Trude, for mercy&rsquo;s sake, for then I have no one to help
      me,&rdquo; cried the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot do otherwise, she has given me my dismissal.&rdquo; Trude approached
      Frau von Werrig respectfully, saying, &ldquo;So I must pack up and go away at
      once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately, you deceitful creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Immediately! but Frau von Werrig will be so good as to give me my wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered in a slower and more subdued voice. &ldquo;That shall be
      done presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be so very difficult to reckon them, I have been here twenty
      years; just as many years as Marie is old, for I came as child&rsquo;s nurse,
      and have helped her learn to talk and walk, and played mother to the dear
      child a bit. Then I obtained my wages, for they were good times; but the
      pension-time came, and we had no cook or servant but me. &lsquo;The rats run
      away if the ship springs a leak,&rsquo; but the old mole Trude stayed. Mankind
      is in the world to work, I said, and why should not I be the cook and
      waiting-maid too, that my little Marie should not want any thing? So I
      became maid-of-all-work and have stayed here ever since. Then, you told me
      you would double my wages, and give me twenty thalers a year, and four
      thalers at Christmas. Is it not so, Frau von Werrig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that was the agreement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite certain about it,&rdquo; cried the general, who began to understand
      the drift of Trude. &ldquo;Yes, Trude was to have twenty thalers a year, and we
      are owing her many years&rsquo; wages. You know, wife, I have always kept an
      account-book for the debts, and only a few days ago&mdash;Oh! oh! the
      pain! Trude, help me cover up the foot warmer!&mdash;we reckoned it up a
      few days ago, and we owe Trude one hundred and thirty thalers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One hundred and thirty thalers,&rdquo; repeated Trude, clapping her hands,
      astonished. &ldquo;Is it true? oh, that is splendid. I shall be rich, and get a
      husband yet. I pray you give it to me, Frau von Werrig, right away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so quickly,&rdquo; said she, proudly. &ldquo;We will reckon together how much you
      have saved&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; interrupted Trude, &ldquo;how good you are to make me keep so much; you
      are my savings bank, where I can deposit my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she continued, with emphasis, without noticing the
      interruption, &ldquo;our future son-in-law will pay your wages, the rich banker,
      Herr Ebenstreit. Yes, the wealthy lover of our daughter. At the moment I
      have not so much cash in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your grace will allow me to stay until Herr Ebenstreit is married, and,
      in your name, pays me my wages?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Trude, I will allow you to stay,&rdquo; she replied, very graciously. &ldquo;You
      will be cunning, Trude, if you try to persuade Marie to accept the rich
      suitor, for when she does I will give you two hundred thalers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do all I can to get it. Can I remain here until Marie is married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have my permission for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, Frau von Werrig. Now, general, I will bring you some warm
      coverings right away.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVI. CHARLES AUGUSTUS AND GOETHE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now tell me, Wolf,&rdquo; asked Duke Charles Augustus, stretching himself
      comfortably on the sofa, puffing clouds of smoke from his pipe&mdash;&ldquo;are
      you not weary of dawdling about in this infamously superb pile of stones,
      called Berlin? Shall we any longer elegantly scrape to the right and to
      the left, with abominable sweet speeches and mere flattering phraseology,
      in this monster of dust and stone, of sand and sun, parades and gaiters?
      Have you not enough of blustering generals, of affected women? and of
      running about the streets like one possessed to see here a miserable
      church, or there a magnificent palace? Are you not weary of crawling about
      as one of the many, while at home you stride about as the only one of the
      many? And weary also of seeing your friend and pupil Carl August put off
      with fair promises and hollow speeches like an insignificant, miserable
      mortal, without being able to answer with thundering invectives. Ah!
      breath fails me. I feel as if I could load a pistol with myself, and with
      a loud report shoot over to dear Weimar. Wolf, do talk, I beg you, I am
      tired out; answer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reply, I shoot, my dear Carl,&rdquo; cried Goethe, laughing. &ldquo;I was out of
      breath myself from that long speech. Was it original with my dear prince,
      or did he memorize it from Klinger&rsquo;s great &lsquo;Sturm-und-Drang&rsquo; tragedy? It
      reminded me of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to accuse me of plagiarism, wicked fellow? I grant that you
      are right, my cunning Wolf, it was a lapsus. I did think of Klinger, and I
      sympathized with his youthful hero Wild, who declared that, among the
      sweetest pleasures, he would like to be stretched over a drum, or exist in
      a pistol-barrel, the hand ready to blow him into the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe shoved aside the breakfast-table, straightened his delicate form,
      with his noble head proudly erect, and one foot in advance, extended his
      right arm, giving one loud hurrah! &ldquo;Now, for once, a tumult and noise,
      that thought may turn about like a weathercock. This savage noise has
      already wrought its own benefit. I begin to feel a little better. Rage and
      expand, mad heart, quicken yourself in hurly-burly-burly-burly!&rdquo; <i>[Footnote:
      From Klinger&rsquo;s tragedy &ldquo;Sturm und Drang.&rdquo;]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! bravo!&rdquo; laughed the duke. &ldquo;Is that Klinger, or who is it that
      refreshes himself in hurly-burly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I who am every thing,&rdquo; replied Goethe, striding and swaggering up
      and down. &ldquo;I was an assistant, in order to be something&mdash;lived upon
      the Alps, tended the goats, lay under the vault of heaven day and night,
      refreshed by the cool pastures, and burned with the inward fire. No peace,
      no rest anywhere. See, I swell with power and health! I cannot waste
      myself away. I would take part in the campaign here; then can my soul
      expand, and if they do me the service to shoot me down, well and good!&rdquo; <i>[Footnote:
      From Klinger&rsquo;s tragedy &ldquo;Sturm und Drang.&rdquo;]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bravo! Wild, bravo!&rdquo; cried the duke. &ldquo;Hei! that thundered and rolled, and
      struck fire! It does me good to hear such vigorous words from an able rare
      genius in the midst of this miserable, starched elegance. The powerful
      Germans are healthy fellows. Something of the Promethean fire blazes forth
      in them. They were forced to come, those jolly, uproarious boys, after the
      affected cue period; they were the full, luxurious plants, and my
      Wolfgang, the favorite of my heart, my poet and teacher, is the divine
      blossom of this plant. Let them prevail, these &lsquo;Sturmer und Dranger,&rsquo; for
      they are the fathers and brothers of my Wolfgang. Do me the sole pleasure
      not to refine yourself too much, but let this divine fire burst forth in
      volcanic flames, and leave the thundering crater uncovered. Sometimes when
      I see you so simpering, so modest and ceremonious, I ask myself, with
      anxiety, if it is the same Wolfgang Goethe, who used to drink &lsquo;Smollis&rsquo; 
      with me at merry bacchanals out of death-skulls?&mdash;the same with whom
      I used to practise whip-cracking upon the market-place hours long, to the
      terror of the good citizens?&mdash;the same who used to dance so nimbly
      the two-steps, and was inexhaustible in mad pranks. Now tell me, Herr
      Wolfgang, are you yourself, or are you another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am myself, and not myself,&rdquo; answered Goethe, smiling. &ldquo;There still
      remains a good portion of folly in me, and it must sometimes thunder and
      flash, but I hope the atmosphere of my soul will become clearer, and over
      the crater a more lovely garden will spread out, in which beautiful,
      fragrant flowers will bloom, useful and profitable for my friends and
      myself. Sometimes I long for this as for the promised land; then again it
      foams and thunders in me like fermenting must, which, defying all covers
      and hoops, would froth up to heaven in an immense source of mad
      excitement!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it froth and foam, and spring the covers, and burst the old casks,&rdquo;
       cried the duke; &ldquo;I delight in it, and every infernal noise you make, the
      prouder I am to recognize that from this foaming must will clear itself a
      marvellous wine, a delicious beverage for gods and men, with which the
      world will yet refresh itself, when we are long gone to the kingdom of
      shades&mdash;to the something or nothing. You know, Wolf, I love you, and
      I am proud that I have you! It is true that I possess only a little duchy,
      but it is large enough to lead an agreeable and comfortable existence&mdash;large
      enough for a little earthly duke, and the great king of intellects, Johann
      Wolfgang Goethe. Let us return to our dear home, for I acknowledge to you
      I sigh for Weimar. I long for the dear little place, where every one knows
      me and greets me, and even for my dogs and horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Goethe, &ldquo;I really mourn for my Tusculum, which I owe to the
      generous, kind duke; for the balcony of my little cottage, where, canopied
      by the blue, starry vault of heaven, I dream away the lonely May nights.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there nothing else you sigh for but the summer-house at Weimar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Goethe, and an indescribable expression of rapture and delight
      was manifest in his whole manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, why should I deny it, how could I? It would be treason to the Highest
      and most Glorious. No, I long for my muse, my mistress, my&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beloved!&rdquo; interrupted the duke. &ldquo;I pray you not to be so prudish, so
      reserved. Have the courage to snap your fingers at this infamously
      deceitful moral code, and proud and distinguished as you are, elevate
      yourself above what these miserable earthworms call morality. For the
      eagle there is a different law than for the pigeon. If the eagle soars
      aloft through the ether to his eyry, bearing a lamb in his powerful claws,
      has he not a right to it&mdash;the right of superiority and power by God&rsquo;s
      grace? Has he not as much right to the lamb as the pigeon to the pea which
      she finds in the dust? If the pigeon by chance sees the eagle with his
      lamb, she cries, &lsquo;Zeter! mordio!&rsquo; with the pea in her own bill, as if she
      were in a position to judge the eagle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful picture,&rdquo; cried Goethe, joyfully&mdash;&ldquo;a picture that would
      inspire me to indite a poem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write one, and call it for a souvenir &lsquo;The Eagle and the Dove.&rsquo; Make it a
      reality, my eagle youth, bear off the white lamb to your eyry, and let the
      world, with its affected morality, say what it likes. How can you bear to
      see the one you love at the side of another man? Tell me, confess to me,
      is not the beautiful Charlotte von Stein your beloved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the sense you mean, duke, not in the vulgar sense of the word. I
      love her, I adore her, with a pure and holy sentiment. I would not that
      Charlotte should have cause to blush before her children on my account.
      She would be desecrated to me if I, in my inmost soul, could imagine the
      blush of shame upon her cheek, or that her eye could brighten at other
      than great, beautiful, and noble acts. I adore her, and to me she is the
      ideal of the purest and sweetest womanhood. I rejoice that she is as she
      is, like clear mountain crystal&mdash;transparent and so brightly pure,
      that one could mirror himself therein. She stands above all other women,
      and to her belong all my thoughts, and would, even if I were wedded to
      another. To me she is the most beautiful of the beautiful, the purest of
      the pure, the most graceful of the graceful, and all my thoughts are in
      perfect harmony with hers. Now, duke, if it is agreeable to you, knowing
      my feelings, to call Charlotte von Stein my beloved, she is so in the most
      elevated sense of the word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you poets, you poets,&rdquo; sighed the duke, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A streak of madness in you all, though I will grant that it is divine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say rather that Whit-Sunday comes to us every day, and the divine Spirit
      descends daily upon us poets, and causes us to speak in unknown tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will say that you are the god Apollo descended from heaven, and with
      gods one may not dare to dispute. They act differently in their sphere
      than we mortals upon earth. I will be contented if our ways cross from
      time to time, and we can once in a while walk on together a good piece the
      way of life in friendship and harmony. If it would please my Wolf, I
      propose to turn toward beloved Weimar, the dear place, half village, half
      city. For my part I am finished here, my business with General von
      Mollendorf is accomplished. As I told you previously, I have had made
      known to the king my refusal to allow recruiting in my duchy. I could not
      consent for the present. In short, I have spoken as my secretary Wolfgang
      Goethe has recorded.<i>[Footnote: This memorial upon recruiting is found.
      &ldquo;Correspondence of the Grand Duke Carl August and Goethe,&rdquo; part, i., p. 4.]</i>
      General Mollendorf has waived his demand for the present&mdash;and to-day
      we have had the concluding conference, and if it is agreeable to my
      secretary, we might set off this afternoon and pass a day at Dessau, and
      then on to Weimar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, gladly will I do it; it seems as if a star from heaven had twinkled
      to me to follow it, for at Weimar is centred all my happiness! I prefer a
      lowly cabin there to all the splendor and palaces of a city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you agree with me, that this magnificently vile Berlin does not
      enchain you in her magic net?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she holds me not, though it has been pleasant to take a peep into it
      (like a child into a curiosity-box). I have seen &lsquo;Old Fritz.&rsquo; His
      character, his gold, and his silver, his marbles, his apes and parrots,
      and even his town curtains please me. It is pleasant to be at the seat of
      war at the very moment that it threatens to break forth. It has gratified
      me to witness the splendor of the royal city, the life, order, and
      abundance, that would be nothing if thousands of men were not ready to be
      sacrificed; the medley of men, carriages, horses, artillery, and all the
      arrangements. All are mere pins in the great clock-work, only puppets
      whose motion is received from the great cylinder, Fredericus Rex, who
      indicates to each one the melody they must play, according to one of the
      thousand pins in the rotary beam.&ldquo;<i>[Footnote: Goethe&rsquo;s own words.&mdash;See
      Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Correspondence with Frau von Stein,&rdquo; part i., p. 168. Riemer,
      &ldquo;Communications about Goethe,&rdquo; part ii., p. 60.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right to compare the great man to the chief cylinder in the
      machine of state,&rdquo; nodded the duke &ldquo;He rules and sets all in motion, and
      cares not whether the rabble are suited or not. It has enraged me
      sometimes to hear the fellows curse him, and yet I acted as if I heard
      them not. Let us return to Weimar&mdash;mankind seems better there, Wolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, more regardful of us than they are here, duke. The greater
      the world the uglier the farce; no obscenities and fooleries of the
      buffoon are more disgusting than the characters of the great, mediocre and
      insignificant, all mingled together. I prayed this morning for courage to
      hold out to the end, and to hasten the consummation. I am grateful for the
      benefit of the journey&mdash;but I pray the gods not to conduct themselves
      toward us as their image-man, for I should swear to them eternal hatred.&ldquo;<i>[Footnote:
      Goethe&rsquo;s own words.&mdash;See Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Correspondence with Frau von
      Stein,&rdquo; part i., p. 169.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are ready to depart, Wolf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Almost, dear Carl, or, if you will it, quite ready. A few visits I would
      make, that the people shall not be too severe upon me and cry out against
      my pride and arrogance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they themselves are proud and supercilious, they are bold enough
      to suppose Wolfgang Goethe is like them. I hope you will not visit the
      very learned Herr Nicolai, the insipid prosaist, the puffed-up
      rationalist, who believes that his knowledge permits him to penetrate
      every thing, and who is a veritable ass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not going to Nicolai, Rammler, or Engel, or, as they should be
      named, the wise authors of Berlin. I shall visit the artist Chodowiecki,
      good Karschin, occasional poetess, and the philosopher Mendelssohn. Then,
      if it pleases you, we will set out this afternoon, shaking the sand of
      Berlin from our feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall prepare whilst you make your visits. Will you take my carriage?
      You know there is one from the royal stables always at my service, which
      stands at the door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware! they would shriek if I should drive to their doors in a royal
      carriage. They would accuse me of throwing aside the poet, and being only
      secretary of legation. I will go on foot; it amuses me to push my way
      through the crowd, and listen to the Berlin jargon.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVII. GOETHE&rsquo;S VISITS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Taking leave of his ducal friend, Goethe betook himself the street, to
      commence his visits. Going first to Chodowiecki, the renowned delineator
      and engraver, whose fame had already spread throughout Germany. When
      Goethe entered, the artist was busy in his atelier, working upon the
      figures of the characters in the &ldquo;Mimic,&rdquo; the latest work of Professor
      Engel. &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said he, smilingly, extending him his hand, &ldquo;I have come
      to thank you for many beautiful, happy hours which I owe to you. You paint
      with the chisel and poetize with the brush. An artist by God&rsquo;s grace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the poet Goethe says that, there must be something in it,&rdquo; replied
      Chodowiecki, with a radiant face. &ldquo;I have to thank you for the most
      beautiful and best hours of my life, and I am proud and delighted to have
      been able in the least to return the pleasure. The only blissful tears
      among many bitter ones that I have wept, were shed over the &lsquo;Sorrows of
      Werther.&rsquo; &lsquo;Gotz von Berlichingen&rsquo; so inspired me that he appeared to me in
      my dreams, and left me no peace until I rose in the night to draw Gotz, as
      he sat talking with brother Martin on the bench in the forest. Wait, I
      will show you the drawing; you must see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe examined it attentively, and expressed his pleasure at the
      correctness and dramatical conception of the design, and did not remark,
      or perhaps would not, that the artist was busily occupied with crayon and
      paper. &ldquo;How wonderfully you have reproduced my &lsquo;German Knight,&rsquo;&rdquo; cried
      Goethe, after a long observation of it. &ldquo;The middle ages entire, proud and
      full of strength, are mirrored in this figure, and if I had not written
      &lsquo;Gotz von Berlichingen,&rsquo; I would have been inspired to it, perhaps, from
      this drawing. Oh! you artists are to be envied. We need many thousand
      words to express what a few lines represent, and a stroke suffices to
      change a smiling face into a weeping one. How feeble is language, and how
      mighty the pencil! I wish I had the talent to be a painter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; cried Chodowiecki, &ldquo;would throw all my pencils, brushes, and
      chisels to the devil, or sell him my soul, if I could cope with the genius
      and intellect of the poet, Wolfgang Goethe. What a man! What a profile the
      gods have given him! There! look&mdash;have you ever seen a man with such
      a face?&rdquo; He handed Goethe the drawing, which proved to be a speaking
      profile-portrait of himself, dashed off with a few strokes full of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goethe looked at it with the air of a critic. &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said he,
      perfectly serious, &ldquo;there are not many such profiles, but I am not of your
      opinion that the gods fashioned it. Those sharp features look as if the
      joiner had cut them out of oak, and they lead me to infer a very
      disagreeable character. I naturally do not know who the picture
      represents, but I must tell you, master, that this man could never please
      me, although I could swear it is a speaking likeness. This sharp, bowed
      nose has something impudent, self-sufficient in it. The brow is indeed
      high, which betokens thought, but the retreating lines prove that the
      thoughts only commence, and then lose themselves in a maze. The mouth,
      with its pouting lips, has an insupportable expression of stupid
      good-nature and sentimentality; and the well-defined, protruding chin
      might belong to the robber-captain Cartouche. The great wide-open eyes,
      with their affected passionate glances, prove what a puffed-up dandy the
      man must be, who perhaps imagines all the women in love with his face. No,
      no, I am still of the opinion that the original could never please me, and
      if the physiognomist Lavater should see it, he would say: &lsquo;That is the
      portrait of a puffed-up, quaint, powerful genius, who imagines himself
      something important, and who is nothing! The likeness of a bombastic
      fellow, with an empty head behind the pretentious brow, and meaningless
      phrases on the thick lips.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Lavater says so, he is a fool and an ass,&rdquo; cried Chodowiecki,
      furiously, &ldquo;and he can hide himself in the remotest corner of the earth.
      Lichtenberg of Gottingen is quite right when he says that this
      empty-headed Lavater has made himself ridiculous throughout Germany with
      his wonderful physiognomy of dogs&rsquo; tails and his profiles of unknown
      pigtails. If Lavater is really so narrow-minded as not to be able to
      distinguish a crow from an eagle, it is his own affair; but he shall never
      presume to look at this portrait, and you, too, are not worthy, you
      scorner, that I should get angry with you. The likeness is so beautiful
      that Jupiter himself would be satisfied to have it imputed to him. It is
      so like, that you need not pretend you do not know that it represents
      Wolfgang Goethe. As you insult it, and regard it with scorn and contempt,
      I will destroy it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake do not tear it,&rdquo; cried Goethe, springing toward
      Chodowiecki, and holding him fast with a firm grasp. &ldquo;My dear good man, do
      not tear it; it would be like splitting my own head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo; shouted Chodowiecki, &ldquo;you acknowledge the likeness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do acknowledge it, with joy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will you admit that it is the head of a noble, talented poet, a
      favorite of the Muses? Say yes, or I will tear it, and you will have
      terrible pains in your head your life long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes! all that you wish. I am capable of saying the most flattering
      things of myself to save this beautiful design. Give it to me, you curious
      fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Chodowiecki, earnestly, &ldquo;I will not give it to you. Such a
      portrait is not made to be put in a dusty portfolio, or framed for the
      boudoir of your lady-love. All Germany, all the world should enjoy it, and
      centuries later the German women will still see Wolfgang Goethe as he
      looked in his twenty-ninth year, and hang an engraving on the wall in
      their parlor, and sighing and palpitating acknowledge&mdash;&lsquo;There never
      was but one such godlike youth, and there never will be another. I wish
      that I had known him; I wish he had loved me!&rsquo; So will they speak
      centuries later, for I will perpetuate this drawing in a steel engraving
      of my most beautiful artistic work.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: This engraving from the
      artist Chodowiecki still exists, and the author of this work possesses a
      beautiful copy, which Ottille von Goethe sent her. It is a bust in
      profile, the most beautiful of his youth.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a splendid fellow, and I must embrace you, and rejoice to be
      immortalized by you, for this portrait pleases me exceedingly. I might
      well be proud that this head with the rare profile is a counterpart of my
      own. Now we are good friends. Before I say farewell, let me see the work
      at which I just disturbed you upon entering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe was about to raise the cloth, when Chodowiecki waved him back. &ldquo;Do
      not look at it,&rdquo; said he, quickly; &ldquo;I dislike to appear as a mechanic
      before you, as I wish that you should honor only the artist. We poor
      toilers are badly off, as the old proverb is ever proving true with us,
      &lsquo;Art goes for bread.&rsquo; We must be mechanics the chief part of our lives, in
      order to have a few hours free, in which we are allowed to be artists. I
      have to illustrate the most miserable works with my engravings, to buy the
      time to pursue works of art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the interest, friend, which you pay the world for the great
      capital which the gods confided to you. Believe me, the artist Chodowiecki
      would have but a morsel to eat if the mechanic Chodowiecki did not serve
      him a tempting meal, paying the bill. Do not be vexed about it; man must
      have a trade to support him, as art is never remunerated. <i>[Footnote:
      Goethe&rsquo;s words&mdash;See G. H. Lewes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Goethe&rsquo;s Life and Writings,&rdquo; vol.
      1., p. 459.]</i> I hope the mechanic will be well paid, that the artist
      may create beautiful and rare works for us. This is my farewell visit
      to-day, friend. If you will hear a welcome from me very soon, come to
      Weimar, and see how one honors the artists there, and how well appreciated
      Chodowiecki is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe embraced and kissed the artist, who regarded him, his face radiant
      with joy, and would not be prevented from accompanying him to the house
      door, as if he were a prince or a king. &ldquo;Now to Madame Karschin,&rdquo; said
      Goethe to himself, as he hastened through the streets in that direction.
      &ldquo;The good woman has welcomed me with so many pretty verses that I must
      make my acknowledgments, in spite of my decision to keep the Berlin
      authors at a distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From Wilhelm Street, where Chodowiecki lived, to the tilt-yard, was not
      far, and Goethe soon reached the old, antiquated house where the poetess
      lived. After many questionings and inquiries at the lower stories and more
      splendid apartments of the house, he found the abode of the poetess, and
      climbed up the steep stairs to the slanting attic-room. The dim light of a
      small window permitted Goethe to read upon a gray piece of paper, pasted
      upon the door, &lsquo;Anna Louisa Karsch, German poetess.&rsquo; He knocked modestly
      at the door at first, then louder, and as the voices within never ceased
      for a moment their animated conversation, he opened it, and entered the
      obscure room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do it, sir,&rdquo; said the little woman sitting in the window-niche
      near a table to a young man standing near her. &ldquo;I will do it, though I
      must tell you album writing is very common. But you must promise me to
      return here, and let me see what Herr Rammler writes, and tell me what he
      says about me. These are my conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frau Karschin, I promise you, upon the word of honor of a German youth,
      who can never lower himself to break his word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well! then I will write.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
There was perfect silence. The youth watched the little, dry hand which
guided the pen, with a devotional mien, and Goethe with eager curiosity,
who, unobserved, stood like a suppliant at the door of the obscure
little room, the shabby furniture of which betrayed the narrow
circumstances of the German poetess. It harmonized with the occupant,
a little, bony, meagre figure, wearing a tight-fitting blue-flowered
chintz dress. Upon the gray hair, which, parted in the middle, encircled
the low forehead, was a cap, which had lost its whiteness and was,
therefore, more in harmony with the ruff about her yellow, thin neck.
Her sharp, angular features were redeemed by large, dark eyes, flashing
with marvellous brilliancy from under the thick, gray eyebrows, and
with quick, penetrating glances she sometimes turned them to the ceiling
thoughtfully as she wrote. &ldquo;There, sir, is my poem,&rdquo; said she, laying
down the pen. &ldquo;Listen:

     &lsquo;Govern your will;
     If it hinders duty,
     It fetters virtue;
     Then envy beguiles
     Into fault-finding.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how beautiful, cried the young man, enraptured. &ldquo;I thank you a
      thousand times for those glorious words, and they shall henceforth be the
      guiding star of my existence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to Professor Rammler, and: then return and show me what he writes, for
      I am convinced&mdash;. Oh, Heavens! there is a stranger,&rdquo; she cried, as
      she discovered Goethe, who had remained standing by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a stranger,&rdquo; said Goethe, smiling, and approaching, as the happy
      possessor of the album withdrew&mdash;&ldquo;a stranger would not leave Berlin
      without visiting the German poetess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And without verses in your album; is it not so? I have become the
      fashion, and if I could only live by immortalizing myself in your albums,
      I should be free from care. Now I have divined it&mdash;you wish an
      autograph?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! only a good word, and a friendly shake of the hand, for I possess a
      poem and a letter which the good Frau Karschin sent me at Weimar some six
      months since, written by herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it Goethe?&rdquo; she cried, clasping her hands in astonishment. &ldquo;The poet
      Johann Wolfgang Goethe, the renowned author of the work which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cost you many tears,&rdquo; broke in Goethe, laughing. &ldquo;I beg you spare me
      these phrases, which follow me upon my journey as the Furies Orestes. I
      know that &lsquo;Werther&rsquo; has become the favorite of the reading public; he has
      opened all the tear-ducts and made all lovers of moonlight as soft as a
      swaddling-cloth. I could punish myself for having written &lsquo;Werther.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frau Karschin laughed aloud. &ldquo;That is glorious! You please me! You are a
      famous poet and a genius, for only geniuses can revise and ridicule
      themselves. Welcome, Germany&rsquo;s greatest poet, welcome to the attic of the
      poetess! There is the good word which you would have, and here is the
      hand. Did you think it worth while to visit poor Karschin? I am rejoiced
      at it, for I see that they accused you unjustly of arrogance and pride!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do they accuse me of it?&rdquo; asked Goethe, smiling. &ldquo;Can the Berlin poets
      and authors never forgive me that I live at a court, and am honored with
      the favor of a prince?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They would willingly forgive you if they had the power to push you one
      side, and take your place. They are angry with you, because they envy you
      and are not accustomed to be esteemed. Our prince and ruler, as great a
      hero and king as he otherwise is, cares little for German poetry, and for
      all he would care, the Berlin authors might starve, one and all; he would
      trouble himself no more about them than the flies dancing in the
      sunlight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The great king is still the same, then? He will never know anything of
      German literature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! he declares that it is the language of barbarians and bear-catchers;
      scolds about us, and despises us, and yet knows as little of us as the man
      in the moon. He adores his Voltaire. Old Fritz knows the French poet by
      heart, but Lessing he knows nothing of. He abuses &lsquo;Goetz von
      Berlichingen,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Werther&rsquo;s Sorrows.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I know it all&mdash;I know the king&rsquo;s adjutant-general, von Siedlitz.
      I often dine with him, and read aloud my poems to him, when he relates to
      me what the king says to enrage me. You must know when I am angry I speak
      in verse. I accustomed myself to it during my unhappy marriage with the
      tailor Karsch. When he scolded, I answered in verse, and tried to turn my
      thoughts to other things, and to make the most difficult rhymes. As he was
      always scolding and quarrelling, I always spoke in rhyme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in this way you led a very poetical marriage?&rdquo; smiled Goethe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, poetical,&rdquo; she said, and her large brilliant eyes were
      dimmed. &ldquo;If it is true that tears are the baptism of poets, then I was
      baptized daily for twelve years, and ought to be an extraordinary
      poetess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you are, indeed,&rdquo; said Goethe, &ldquo;who would dispute it? You have given
      evidence of great poetical talent, and I read your heroic poem upon the
      Great Frederick with real delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what he did?&rdquo; she asked, bitterly. &ldquo;I turned to him, begging
      for assistance; for who should a poet turn to, but his God and his king?
      Moreover, he had promised it to me personally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have spoken with him, then, yourself?&rdquo; asked Goethe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, eight years ago; General von Siedlitz procured me an audience. The
      king was very gracious, and among other things, asked me about my life;
      and as I explained to him my poverty and want, he most kindly promised to
      help me.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: This interview which Frau Karschin had with the
      king is found in &ldquo;Anecdotes and Traits of Character of Frederick the
      Great.&rdquo; vol. ii., p. 72.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did he not fulfil his promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, had it been given to the least of the French writers he would have
      kept it, but to a German poet it was not worth while. What is a native
      poet to the great German king? A phantom that he knows not, and believes
      not. As great as he is, the king showed himself very small to me. I sang
      him as a poetess and he bestowed a pittance upon me as one would to a
      beggar in tatters by the wayside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it really true, upon your supplication&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sent me two thalers! Yes, that is indeed true, and I see by your smile
      that you know it, and know also that I returned it to him. I had rather
      die with hunger than take a beggar&rsquo;s penny. But let me relate to you what
      happened two weeks since. I had borne patiently the affair of the two
      thalers, and forgotten it. I am more comfortable now; the booksellers pay
      me for my songs and poems very well, and a number of patrons and friends,
      at whose head is the Prince of Prussia, give me a small pension, from
      which I can at least live&mdash;though poorly. One of my patrons sent me a
      strip of land on the Spree not far from the Hercules Bridge, where I would
      gladly build me a little house, at last to have a sure abiding-place where
      I could retire&mdash;that would be a refuge against all the troubles and
      sorrows of life. As I thought it over, the old confidence and imperishable
      love for the great king rose again within me, and as I esteemed him I
      always hoped for the fulfilment of his promise. I applied to him again,
      and begged him to do for me what he had granted to so many cobblers and
      tailors, as the king gives building-money to help those who will build.
      All the houses of the Gensdarmen-markt are built by royal aid, and
      sometimes the king designs the facades, as he did for the butcher Kuhn&rsquo;s
      great house; and sent him a design to ornament the frieze of ninety-nine,
      sheeps&rsquo; heads, only ninety-nine, for he said the butcher himself was the
      one hundredth. The butcher remonstrated, but he was obliged to keep them,
      if he would have the building-money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; cried Goethe, laughing, &ldquo;the king is an ingenious and
      extraordinary man in every thing, and no one is like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one is like him, and no one would have treated me as he did. I
      addressed to him a poem, begging him with true inspiration and emotion to
      let a German poetess find favor in his sight&mdash;and that he would be
      for me a Maecenas, if I were not a Horace. My heart bled with sorrow, that
      I must so beg and pray, and my tears wet the paper upon which I indited my
      begging, rhyming petition. How much money do you think the great king sent
      me for my house? Think of the smallest sum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it was small, yet for building-money he would send you at least two
      hundred thalers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The poetess burst into a scornful laugh. &ldquo;He sent me three thalers! The
      great Frederick sent me three thalers to build a house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do? Did you take them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, proudly, &ldquo;and I will leave them as a legacy to my
      daughter, as an historical souvenir for succeeding generations, who will
      relate the benevolence of the German king for the German poetess. I sent
      the king a receipt&mdash;I will read it to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;His majesty commanded, Instead of building-money, To send me three
      thalers. The order was exactly, Promptly fulfilled. I am indebted for
      thanks, But for three thalers can No joiner in Berlin My coffin make.
      Otherwise to-morrow I would order Such a house without horror Where worms
      feast, And, feasting, quarrel Over the lean, care-worn Old woman&rsquo;s remains
      That the king let sigh away.&rsquo;&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: See &ldquo;Life and Poems of Louisa
      Karschin,&rdquo; edited by her daughter.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not laugh?&rdquo; said Frau Karschin, raising her flashing eyes to
      Goethe, who sat looking down earnestly and quietly before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he gently answered. &ldquo;Your poem makes me sad; it recalls the
      keen sorrow of a poet&rsquo;s existence, the oft-repeated struggle between
      Ideality and Reality. The blessed of the gods must humble themselves;
      though they may raise their heads to heaven, their feet must still rest
      upon earth; and to find their way upon it, and walk humbly therein, they
      must again lower their inspired heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that makes me feel better,&rdquo; cried Karschin, with tears in her eyes;
      &ldquo;that is balsam for my wounds. You are a great poet, Goethe, I feel it to
      be so. You are a great man, for your heart is good and filled with pity.
      How unjustly they call you cold and proud! Only be a little more yielding,
      and call upon the Berlin poets and writers. You can imagine that the news
      of your arrival ran like wild-fire through the town. Nicolai, Rammler,
      Engel, Mendelssohn, and all the other distinguished gentlemen have stayed
      at home like badgers in their kennels, watching for you, so as not to miss
      your visit. At last they became desperate, and scolded furiously over your
      arrogance and pride in thinking yourself better than they. Why have you
      not called upon them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a loud knocking at the door, and the young man with his album
      entered, almost breathless. &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I came directly from
      Professor Rammler here, as I promised you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him, then? Has he written something for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw him, and he granted my request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And abused me, did he not, with his nose turned up? You must know,
      Goethe, that Professor Rammler despises my poems, because I am not so
      learned in Greek and Roman mythology as he is. Now tell me, my young
      friend, what did he say about me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised you, upon my word of honor, to tell you every thing, but I
      hope you will release me from the promise.&rdquo; sighed the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that I will not. Much more, upon the strength of your word of honor,
      I desire it. You promised, word for word, to relate it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it must be, then, let it be. I went at once to Professor Rammler&rsquo;s. He
      asked me immediately if I had not been here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as I asked you,&rdquo; laughed Karschin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I affirmed it, saying that you showed me his house. Upon which he asked,
      &lsquo;Did she say any thing against me? She is accustomed to do it before
      strangers, like all old women.&rsquo; He then turned over my album, and as he
      saw the lines you wrote he reddened, and striking the book&mdash;&lsquo;I see
      it, she knew she had said something about me. She tells every stranger
      that I think she is censorious. What she has written is aimed at me.&rsquo; Upon
      that he wrote some lines opposite yours, shut the book, and handed it to
      me. I have not even had the time to read them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read them now, quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;He who slanders and listens to slander, let him be punished. She may be
      hung by the tongue, and he by the ears.&rsquo;&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: This scene took
      place literally, and may be found in &ldquo;Celebrated German Authors,&rdquo; vol.
      II., p. 340.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is shameful&mdash;that is mean!&rdquo; said Frau Karschin, while Goethe
      re-read the cutting epigram. &ldquo;That is just like Rammler; his tongue is
      like a two-edged sword for every one but himself, and he fans his own
      glories, and does not know that he is a fool. Frederick the Great himself
      called him so. One of his generals called his attention to him, upon which
      Frederick turned his horse, riding directly up to him, asking, &lsquo;Is this
      the distinguished Rammler?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, your majesty, I am he,&rsquo; the little
      professor proudly bowed. &lsquo;You are a fool!&rsquo; called out Frederick, very
      loud, and rode away, as all around the &lsquo;Great Rammler&rsquo; laughed and
      sneered. There are many such stories. Shall I tell you how Lessing teased
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear woman, tell me nothing more. I perceive your Berlin writers and
      poets are a malicious, contentious set of people. I may well fear you, and
      shall be glad to escape unharmed. Think kindly of me, and have pity upon
      me; if the others are too severe, raise your dear hand and hold back the
      scourge that it may not fall upon poor Wolfgang Goethe. Adieu, dear Frau
      Karschin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe bowed, and hastened down into the street. &ldquo;With the authors and
      poets of Berlin I wish nothing more to do, but with the philosophers I may
      be more fortunate, and with them find the wisdom and forbearance which
      fail the poets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe bent his steps to Spandauer Street, in which the merchant and
      philosopher Moses Mendelssohn lived; hastened up the stairs, and knocked,
      which was answered by an old servant, to whom Goethe announced himself.
      The servant disappeared, and the poet stood in the little, narrow
      corridor, smilingly looking to the study-door, and waiting for the &ldquo;gates
      of wisdom&rdquo; to open and let the worldling enter the temple of philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crooked little man, the great philosopher, Moses, son of Mendelssohn,
      stood behind the door, turning over in his mind whether he would receive
      Goethe or not. &ldquo;Why should I? The proud secretary of legation has already
      been in Berlin eight days, and wishes to prove to me that he cares little
      for Berlin philosophers. My noble friend, the great Lessing, cannot abide
      &lsquo;Gotz von Berlichingen;&rsquo; and Nicolai, Rammler, and Engel are the bitter
      opponents, the very antipodes of the rare genius and secretary of legation
      from Weimar. If he wishes to see me, why did he come so late, so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herr Goethe is waiting&mdash;shall he enter?&rdquo; asked the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher raised his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; cried he, loudly. &ldquo;No! tell him you
      were mistaken. I am not at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old servant looked quite frightened at his master&mdash;the first time
      he had heard an untruth from him. &ldquo;What shall I say, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say no,&rdquo; cried Moses, very excited and ill-humored. &ldquo;Say that I am not at
      home&mdash;that I am out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a determined, defiant manner the philosopher seated himself to work
      upon his new book, &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; saying to himself, &ldquo;I am right to send him
      away; he waited too long, is too late.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: From Ludwig Tieck I
      learned this anecdote, and he assured me that Moses Mendelssohn told it to
      him.&mdash;See &ldquo;Goethe in Berlin, Leaves of Memory,&rdquo; p. 6.&mdash;The
      Authoress.]</i>

      CHAPTER XVIII. FAREWELL TO BERLIN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter, my dear Wolf?&rdquo; cried the duke, as Goethe returned
      from his visits. &ldquo;What mean those shadows upon your brow? Have the cursed
      beaux-esprits in Berlin annoyed and tortured you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, duke, I&mdash;&rdquo; and suddenly stopping, he burst into a loud ringing
      laugh, and sprang about the room, bounding up and down, shouting, &ldquo;Hurrah!
      hurrah! Long live the philosophers, vivat the philosophers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall live&mdash;live&mdash;live,&rsquo;&rsquo; shouted the duke!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vivat the philosophers! hurrah! To the May-sports upon the Blockberg they
      ride upon a little ass with golden horns&mdash;with Pharisaical mien,
      praying with their eyes, &lsquo;I thank Thee, O Lord, that I am a philosopher,
      that I am not as the world&rsquo;s children, vain, proud, and arrogant.&rsquo; Hey,
      good Carl Augustus, today a great revelation has been made known to me by
      a philosopher. Wisdom flowed from his mouth. All the spiders in their
      gray, self-woven nets, whispered and sang in his corridor, &lsquo;We weave at
      the fountain of life, we spin the web of time.&rsquo; The little mice crept out
      from the corners, whispering, Hallelujah! Here lives the great philosopher
      Moses, who has devoured wisdom, and is unknowing of earthly vanities. Oh!
      the mice and the spiders waltz together upon the threshold of the great
      philosopher. Hey, ha! a waltz we will dance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe caught the duke with both arms around the waist, and tore around in
      a giddy whirl, both laughing, both shrieking. Wolfshund, the duke&rsquo;s dog,
      asleep in the corner, sprang up howling and barking at their wild bounds
      and goat-like springs, and joined the dancers. As Goethe felt the ribbon
      which confined his cue give way, he shook wildly his curly, powdered hair
      and it fell in mad confusion. Both he and the duke now sank exhausted to
      the floor, panting and laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven be praised, Wolf,&rdquo; said the duke, &ldquo;the must has once more
      fermented, and sprung a few of the hoops of dignity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Goethe, who suddenly assumed a grave, serious mien, &ldquo;the
      must has fermented, and I trust a fine wine will clear itself from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you not set off, Wolf?&rdquo; asked the duke, springing up. &ldquo;Have you had
      sufficient of the Berliners?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done with them,&rdquo; replied Goethe, &ldquo;not only with the Berliners, but
      it may be with all the rest of humanity. I feel, my duke, that the bloom
      of confidence, candor, and self-sacrificing love fades daily; only for
      you, and the friend whom I love, is there still attraction and flagrancy.
      Oh! you dear ones, be charitable, and do not consent that they fade for
      you. Let the goodness which I read in your eyes, my dear Carl, and the
      sunny rays of friendship strengthen the poor little blossom, that it does
      not entirely fade and wither away!&rdquo; With passionate earnestness he threw
      his arms around the duke, pressing him to his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Wolf, my dear Wolf, you have a child&rsquo;s heart and a poet&rsquo;s soul. Are
      you faint-hearted and dispirited? Do you not know that you are the sun
      which brings forth the flowers for us, and shines for us all? Let no
      clouds overshadow you, Wolf! Let your fresh, youthful vigor, and divine
      brilliancy, penetrate them. In the thick, sandy atmosphere of Berlin I
      confess the sun itself loses its force and brightness! Come! let us be
      off. Our steeds stamp with impatience.&rdquo; The duke drew his friend from the
      room and joyfully they sprang down the stairs to the carriage, the great
      dog following, howling and barking after them. &ldquo;Forward, then, forward!
      Blow, postilion, blow! A gay little air! Let it peal through the streets,
      a farewell song! Blow, postilion, blow! and I will moisten your throat at
      the gates with the thin, white stuff, which you have the boldness to call
      beer.&rdquo; The postilion laughed for joy, and the German song resounded in
      quivering tones&mdash;&ldquo;Three riders rode out of the gate.&rdquo; He blew so long
      and loudly, that the dog set up a mournful howl, and amid the peals of the
      postilion, and the distressed cry of Wolfshund, they drove through the
      long, hot streets of Berlin, through the Leipsic Gate, and the suburbs
      with their small, low houses. The wagon-wheels sank to the spokes in the
      loose, yellow sand of the hill they soon mounted, and, arriving at the top
      of which, the postilion stopped to let his horses take breath, and turned
      to remind his aristocratic passengers that this was their last view of the
      city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will be seen no more,&rdquo; repeated the duke. &ldquo;Come, let us take a
      farewell look at Berlin, Wolf!&rdquo; and away they sprang without waiting for
      the footman to descend, and waded through the sand to a rising in the
      fallow fields. There they stood, arm in arm, and viewed the town with its
      towers and chimneys, houses, barracks, and palaces stretched at their
      feet. A thick, gray, cloud of vapor and smoke hovered over it, and veiled
      the horizon in dust and fog. &ldquo;Farewell, Berlin, you city of arrogance and
      conceit!&rdquo; cried the duke, joyfully. &ldquo;I shake your dust from my feet, and
      strew the sand of your fields over every souvenir of you in memory,&rdquo; and
      suiting the action to his words, he tossed a handful of it in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, Muses and Graces of sand and dust!&rdquo; cried Goethe, as his fiery
      eye flashed far out over the fog-enveloped roofs. &ldquo;Farewell, Berlin, void
      of nature and without verdure! the abode of poetic art, but not of poesy.
      You Babylon of wisdom and philosophy, I have seen you with your painted
      cheeks and coquettish smile, your voluptuous form and seductive charms.
      You shall never ensnare me with your deceitful beauty, and suck the marrow
      from my bones, or the consciousness of pure humanity from my soul.
      Beautiful may you be to enslaved intellects, but to the free, they turn
      their backs to you and thrice strew ashes on your head. Farewell, Berlin,
      may I never see you again!&rdquo; <i>[Goethe, in fact, never visited Berlin
      again, though he was often invited there, particularly when the new
      theatre was opened, with a poetic prologue written by himself. They
      inaugurated the festivity with Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Iphigenia,&rdquo; the first
      representation, and Prince Radzwill urgently invited the poet, through
      Count Bruhl, to visit Berlin at this time, and reside in his palace. But
      Goethe refused; he was seventy-two years old (1826), and excused himself
      on account of his age.]</i> Goethe stooped and threw a handful of sand in
      the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The postilion, tired of standing in the burning sun, blew loudly the air
      of the soldier&rsquo;s song: &ldquo;Now, adieu, Louisa, wipe your face, every ball
      does not hit.&rdquo; Mournfully the melody sounded in the stillness, like
      accusing spirits who wept the insult of the prince and the poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, on to our dear Weimar, Wolf!&rdquo; The carriage rolled down the sandy
      hill, and Berlin disappeared to the travellers, lost in dreamy thought.
      Slowly they advanced, in spite of relays and fresh horses at every
      station. Night spread out her starry mantle over the world, and the
      sleepers who rested from the burdens and cares of the day. Goethe alone
      was wakeful and vigilant. With his beautiful eyes, as brilliant as fallen
      stars, uplifted to heaven, to God, his manly bosom heaving with noble
      thoughts and glorious aspirations, he reviewed the past, and recalled with
      joy that he had accomplished much and well. He peered into the future, and
      promised himself to do more and better. &ldquo;Yes, I will,&rdquo; whispered he
      softly, pointing to the stars; &ldquo;so high as possible shall the pyramid of
      my being rise. To that I will constantly bend my thoughts, never
      forgetting it, for I dare not tarry; with the years already on my head,
      fate may arrest my steps, and the tower of Babylon remain unfinished. At
      least they must acknowledge the edifice was boldly designed, and if I
      live, God willing, it shall rise.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIX. THE KING AND THE AUSTRIAN DIPLOMAT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frederick commenced the campaign against the house of Hapsburg with all
      the energy and bold courage of former days. The diplomats had once more
      been permitted to seek the arts of negotiation, and, these having failed,
      the king advanced rapidly, and entered Bohemia with his advance-guard. The
      imperial army, informed of the approach of the enemy, retired hurriedly to
      their intrenchments at Koeniggratz, beyond the Elbe, without a decisive
      battle. In the skirmishes at the outposts the Prussians had been
      victorious. On the opposite shore of the Elbe, at Welsdorf, the king took
      up his headquarters. Why did he not pursue his bold run of victory? Why
      did he not surprise the imperial army, which he knew was scattered, and
      not in a position to resist the strength of the Prussian forces? Moreover,
      the second column of the Prussian army, under the command of Prince Henry,
      had also entered Bohemia, and fortified a camp near Rimburg, having united
      with the Saxon allies, which caused the imperialists under Field-Marshal
      Loudon to seek protection beyond the Iser, near Muenchengratz and
      Yung-bunzlau. Why did the king then stop in the midst of his victorious
      career? He had advanced to the field with his fresh, youthful fire, a
      shining example to all. He was always mounted, shunning no danger, but
      taking part in the hardships and fatigue incident to the changing life of
      war; even showing himself personally active at the discovery of
      foraging-parties. Why did he suddenly hesitate and lie inactive in camp?
      Why did he not summon his generals and staff-officers to his quarters,
      instead of his Minister von Herzberg? Every one asked himself the
      question, and every one answered it differently.&mdash;Some said, &ldquo;Because
      the Empress of Russia had raised objections to this war of German
      brothers;&rdquo; others, that &ldquo;the King of the French had offered to settle the
      quarrel as intermediator.&rdquo; A third said, the &ldquo;empress-queen, Maria
      Theresa, was terrified at the rapid advance of the Prussians, and had
      immediately commenced negotiations for peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the wise politicians of Germany and all Europe read and pondered,
      Frederick tarried quietly in his peasant-house, in which he had taken up
      his quarters, and which had been arranged very comfortably with carpets,
      camp-stools, and curtains. He sat in his cabinet upon the high,
      leather-covered arm-chair, which had been brought for him from the
      neighboring parsonage. Alkmene lay upon his knee, and Diana at his feet.
      His countenance was pale, and betrayed fatigue, but his eye beamed with
      undimmed brilliancy, and around his mouth played an ironical smile. &ldquo;Well,
      so matters stand; therefore, I have summoned you to Welsdorf,&rdquo; said
      Frederick to his minister, Von Herzberg. &ldquo;The empress-queen is, above all
      things, a most tender mother. She is fearfully anxious, now that the dear
      young Emperor Joseph has left for the army, and will be exposed to the
      dangers of war. My good friends in Vienna inform me that my entrance into
      Bohemia created a sensation at the brilliant capital, and had so much
      alarmed the empress-queen, that she was seriously thinking of negotiating
      for peace. As I learned this from a reliable source, I halted and
      encamped, that the empress should know where to find me, and sent to
      summon you immediately. I had not been here three days, when the empress&rsquo;s
      ambassador, Baron von Thugut, appeared to make offers, and consult about
      an armistice of two weeks. I made known my conditions, and promised the
      empress, through her negotiator, that I would so calculate my movements
      that her majesty would have nothing to fear for her blood and her
      cherished emperor. <i>[Footnote: The king&rsquo;s words.&mdash;See &ldquo;Prussia,
      Frederick the Great,&rdquo; vol. iv., p. 102.]</i> Voila, mon cher ministre, you
      know all now. If the Austrian diplomat comes a second time, you can
      negotiate with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your majesty also inclined to peace?&rdquo; asked Herzberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;When it can be arranged with honor,
      yes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I will acknowledge, Herzberg, to you, the campaign is hard
      for me. The old fellow of sixty-eight feels the burden of life, and would
      gladly rest quietly, and enjoy the last few years as philosopher and
      writer instead of soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty has yet many years to live, God willing,&rdquo; cried Herzberg.
      &ldquo;It would be a great misfortune to Prussia if she could not yet owe to her
      great king a long and happy reign.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; replied the king, &ldquo;there are in Prussia very many who think
      otherwise, and wish me to the devil. But I have no intention of seeking
      monsieur so soon, for there are sufficient devilish deeds to endure in
      this earthly vale of sorrow to prepare for one a very decent purgatory,
      and give him hereafter well-founded hopes of heaven. Therefore I count
      upon remaining here below a while, and to knead with you this leaven of
      life that may yield to my subjects an eatable bread. You must help me,
      Herzberg, when I am the baker, to provide the flour for my people; you
      must be the associate to knead the bread. In order that the flour should
      not fail, and the bread give out, it may be necessary, if possible, to
      make peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your majesty be so gracious as to inform me what steps I may take,
      and upon what conditions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take this paper,&rdquo; said the king, extending a written document to
      Herzberg. &ldquo;I have therein expressed my wishes, and you can act
      accordingly. I am prepared for peace upon any terms which can be made with
      honor, and which do not frustrate the aim I have in view. You well know
      that this is the security of Germany against Austria&rsquo;s ambitious love of
      territorial aggrandizement! I cannot and I will not suffer that the house
      of Habsburg should strive for unjust possession in Germany, and
      appropriate Bavaria to herself while a lawful heir exists. I well know
      that I play the role of Don Quixote, and am about to fight for the rights
      of Germany as the Chevalier de la Mancha fought for his Dulcinea del
      Toboso. Mais, que voulez-vous, it is necessary for my fame and repose that
      I enter the arena once more against Austria to prove to her that I exist.
      I take this step on account of the prestige I have gained in the German
      empire, and which I should lose if I had not faced Austria in this
      Bavarian contest. And besides, it is agreeable to me to accustom my
      successor to the thunder of cannon, and witness his bearing on the field
      of battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will certainly do honor to the heroic race of Hohenzollern,&rdquo; answered
      Herzberg, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden flash from the king&rsquo;s fiery eyes met the calm pale face of
      Herzberg. &ldquo;Mere words and flattery, which prove that you are not
      satisfied, Herzberg! Nay, nay, do not deny it; you do not like that I
      should tarry and treat, and set the pen in motion instead of the sword.
      You are a man of deeds, and if you had had your way, I should have already
      won a decisive battle, and be on the road to Vienna to besiege the empress
      in her citadel, and dictate an humiliating peace to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, I can assure you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, do not quarrel!&rdquo; interrupted the king; &ldquo;do you suppose I
      cannot read your honest and obstinate face? Do you suppose I did not mean
      what I said? Acknowledge that I am right! confess it, I command you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If your majesty commands it, then I will acknowledge it. Yes, I did wish
      that your majesty had not empowered Baron von Thugut to return for further
      negotiations. It would have been well if your majesty had marched
      victorious to Vienna, to let the proud Hapsburgers see for once that
      Frederick of Prussia does not stand behind them, but at their side; that
      he has created a new order of things; that the old, mouldy, rotten
      statutes of the imperial sovereignty have fallen in the dust before
      Frederick the Great; that Germany must be newly mapped out, in order to
      give room near the old man Austria for young Prussia. Yes, your majesty, I
      could have wished that you had even been less generous, less noble toward
      the supercilious, insolent enemy, and have accepted no conditions but
      those of &lsquo;equality for Prussia with Austria in the German empire!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;My dear sir, I am truly astonished at the vigor with which you express
yourself; I am very glad to find you so enthusiastic,&rdquo; said Frederick,
nodding to his minister; &ldquo;but listen&mdash;I will confide to you that which
I do not wish you to repeat: I am no longer, to my regret, what you so
flatteringly call me, &lsquo;Frederick the Great,&rsquo; but only &lsquo;Old Fritz.&rsquo; Do
you understand me? the latter is a deplorable, worn-out soldier, who no
longer feels power or vigor. The lines of Boileau often recur to me on
mounting my horse:

     &lsquo;Unfortunate one, leave thy steed growing old in peace,
     For fear, that, panting and suddenly out of breath,
     In falling, he may not leave his master upon the arena!&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      It is the misery of life that man will grow old, and that the body, when
      worn and weary, will even subdue the spirit, and force her to fold her
      wings and suffer. I did not realize that it had gone so far with me, and I
      imagined that the winged soul could raise the old, decayed body. Therefore
      I risked, in spite of my lazy old age, to undertake this war, for I
      recognized it as a holy duty to enter into it, for the honor and justice
      of our country, and prove to the Emperor of Germany that he could not
      manage and rule at his will in the German empire. I long not for the honor
      of new laurels, but I should be satisfied, as father of my subjects, to
      gain a civil crown.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have my creed. I have as sincerely confessed to you as my
      respectable cousin, the empress-queen, to her confessor; only I did not
      fall upon my knees to you, and you do not as the said confessor, betray me
      to the Holy Father at Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty well knows that every word which you have the grace to
      confide to me, is engraved upon my inmost soul, and that no power upon
      earth could force me to reveal it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that you are a true and zealous servant of your king and country,&rdquo;
       said Frederick. &ldquo;Once more I say to you, other than an honorable peace I
      will not make; and if empress-queen does not accept the abandonment of
      Bavaria as the basis of peace, then I must conquer my aversion to war, and
      the sword must arrange what the pen has failed to do. And now, passons
      ladessus! Until Thugut arrives, let us speak of other things. I have been
      tolerably industrious, and have improved the leisure of camp-life as much
      as possible. I have written a panegyric upon Voltaire, and when it is
      revised and corrected you shall arrange an anniversary in memoriam, at the
      Berlin Academy, and read my eulogy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All Germany and all Europe will be surprised at the magnanimity of the
      royal mind which could occupy itself in the camp with the muse, and erect
      an imperishable monument to the man who witnessed such ingratitude and
      baseness to his benefactor and protector.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Vous allez trop vite, mon cher; vraiment, trop vite,&rdquo; cried Frederick,
      ardently. &ldquo;It is true Voltaire was a miserable fellow, but he was a great
      poet. He returned meanness and ingratitude to me for the many kindnesses I
      showed to him, for I treated him more like a friend than a king. Voltaire
      was my benefactor, in so far that I owed to him the most agreeable and
      elevating hours of my youth, In memory of these hours I have written this
      eulogy. It is not worthy of particular mention, and the Academie Francaise
      will doubtless severely criticise my knowledge of their language. But it
      is impossible to write well, one moment in camp and another on the march.
      If it is unworthy of him whom it was intended to celebrate, I have at
      least availed myself of the freedom of the pen, and will cause to be
      publicly read in Berlin what one dares not whisper in Paris.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote:
      The king&rsquo;s own words.&mdash;&ldquo;Posthumous Works,&rdquo; vol. xv., p. 109. This
      eulogy upon Voltaire, which the king wrote in camp, Herzberg read, in the
      November following, before the Academy.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be most happy to be the instrument to make known this generous
      expression of your majesty&rsquo;s good-will,&rdquo; remarked Herzberg, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frederick smiled, adding: &ldquo;But with the other work which I have commenced,
      you are not quite satisfied. You are such an enthusiastic German, that you
      presume to assert that the intolerable German jargon is a beautiful and
      expressive language!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I abide by this decision, your majesty,&rdquo; zealously cried Herzberg.
      &ldquo;The German language is euphonious, and prolific in ideas, and it is well
      capable of rivalling in brevity and clearness those of the ancients.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you have already asserted, and I have contested it, and again I
      contest it to-day. Do not trouble me with your German language. It will
      only deserve notice when great poets, distinguished orators, and admirable
      historians, have given it their attention and corrected it, freeing it
      from such disgusting and effeminate phrases as now disfigure it, and cause
      one to use a mass of words to express a few ideas. At present it is only
      an accumulation of different dialects, which every division of the German
      empire thinks to speak the best, and of which twenty thousand can scarcely
      understand what the other twenty thousand are saying!&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: The
      king&rsquo;s own words.&mdash;See &ldquo;Posthumous Works,&rdquo; vol. xv.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; cried Herzberg, with vehemence, &ldquo;should a German king thus speak
      of his native tongue, at the same time that he takes the field to
      vindicate the honor of Germany, and submits to all the miseries and
      hardships of war? Your majesty cannot be in earnest, to despise our
      beautiful language.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not despise it; I only say that it must be reformed, and shorn of
      its excrescences. Until then we must use the French, which is to-day the
      language of the world, and in which one can render all the master-works of
      the Greeks and the Latins, with the same versatility, delicacy, and
      subtlety, as the original. You pretend that one can well read Tacitus in a
      German translation, but I do not think the language capable of rendering
      the Latin authors with the same brevity as the French.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, to my joy, I can give you proof to the contrary. A Berlin savant,
      Conrector Moritz, at my request, has translated a few chapters of the
      fourteenth book of the &lsquo;Annals of Tacitus,&rsquo; word for word, most faithfully
      into German. He has written it in two columns, the translation at the side
      of the original. I have taken the liberty to bring this work with me and
      you will see how exactly, and with what brevity, Latin authors can be
      rendered into German, and that there are young learned men who have seized
      the spirit of our language and know how to use it with grace and skill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, give it to me,&rdquo; cried the king, zealously. &ldquo;I am truly curious to
      admire the German linguist&rsquo;s work who has so boldly undertaken to
      translate Tacitus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Herzberg, raising his eyes knowingly, with a mild, imploring
      expression to the king&rsquo;s face&mdash;&ldquo;sire, I join a request with this
      translation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? I am very curious about a petition from you, it is so seldom
      that you proffer one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, my request concerns the translator of this very chapter of
      Tacitus. He is Conrector Moritz, attached to the Gray Cloister in Berlin&mdash;an
      unusually gifted young man, who has undoubtedly a brilliant future before
      him. He has already written many eminent works. The Director Gedicke
      recommended him to me as a most distinguished, scholarly person, and I
      have learned to know and appreciate the young man by this means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see it,&rdquo; nodded the king. &ldquo;You speak of him with great enthusiasm, and
      as what you so warmly recommend is generally able and well qualified, I
      begin to be interested in this Herr Moritz. When I return to Berlin&mdash;and
      Heaven grant that it may be soon!&mdash;I will at once empower you to
      present this luminary. Are you satisfied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, dare I ask still more? I would beg your majesty to grant this young
      man an audience at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, at once! Is this phoenix here, who so interests my Minister
      Herzberg? Where is he from, and what does he wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is from Berlin; I met him making the journey on foot. He sat upon a
      stone, by the wayside, eating a piece of bread, with a glowing face, and
      so absorbed talking to himself in Latin that he heard not the creaking of
      my carriage through the sand. I recognized him immediately, and called him
      by name. He turned, perfectly unembarrassed and not at all ashamed to have
      been discovered in such an humble and poor position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, he is a good comedian,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;He knew that you
      would drive past there, and placed himself expressly to call your
      attention to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, sire; Conrector Moritz could not have known that I would
      take this journey. You will recollect that the courier arrived at midnight
      with your majesty&rsquo;s commands, and two hours later I was on the road, and
      have since travelled day and night. As I met the young man only five miles
      from this place, he must have set out many days before I thought of
      leaving Berlin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;it was a false suspicion. You invited him
      into your carriage, did you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did very naturally, sire, as he told me he was going to beg an audience
      of your majesty. At first he refused decidedly, as he wished to travel on
      foot, like the pilgrims to the pope at Rome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An original, a truly original genius,&rdquo; cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is so indeed, and is so called by all his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he any friends?&rdquo; asked the king, with an incredulous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, many warm and sympathizing friends, who are much attached to
      him, and, on account of his distinguished and brilliant qualities, are
      willing to indulge his peculiarities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herzberg, you are charmed, and speak of this man as a young girl in
      love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, if I were a young girl, I should certainly fall in love with this
      Moritz, for he is handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diable! I begin to fear this subject. You say he is handsome, learned,
      wise, and good, although he belongs to the airy, puffed-up Berliners. Did
      you let Herr Moritz wander on in his pilgrimage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sire, I persuaded him at last to accept a seat in my carriage, by
      explaining to him that your majesty might soon leave Welsdorf, and he
      would run the risk of not arriving in season. Upon no condition would he
      get inside, but climbed up behind, for, said he, with a firm, decided
      manner, &lsquo;I go to the king as a beggar, not as a distinguished gentleman.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is an original,&rdquo; the king murmured to himself. &ldquo;Do you know
      what the man wants?&rdquo; he asked aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, your majesty; he said that his business concerned the happiness of
      two human beings, and that he could only open his heart to his God and his
      king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is your protege?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He stands outside, and it is my humble request that your majesty will
      grant him an audience, and permit me to call him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is granted, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just at that moment the door opened, and the footman announced that the
      private secretary of his highness Prince von Galitzin had arrived, and
      most respectfully begged an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is he&mdash;it is the baron,&rdquo; said the king. &ldquo;Tell your protege he
      must wait, and come again. Bid the Prince von Galitzin enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the Minister von Herzberg withdrew, the Baron von Thugut appeared, the
      extraordinary and secret ambassador of the Empress Maria Theresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Herr Baron, you are already returned,&rdquo; said the king, as he
      scarcely nodded to the profoundly respectful bows of the ambassador. &ldquo;I
      infer, therefore, that your instructions are not from the empress, but
      from the co-regent, the Emperor Joseph, who has betaken himself to the
      Austrian camp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; answered Thugut, laconically, &ldquo;I have driven day and night, and
      have received my instructions directly from the empress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king slowly shook his head, and an imperceptible smile played around
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the young emperor approve of these instructions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, his majesty, the emperor, is only the co-regent,&rdquo; answered Thugut,
      hastily. &ldquo;It is not therefore necessary, that my sovereign should make her
      decisions dependent upon her son&rsquo;s concordance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The empress will negotiate for peace,&rdquo; said the king to himself, &ldquo;but the
      emperor desires to win laurels in the war, and will try to cut off the
      negotiations of his mother by a coup de main. One must be on his guard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the door opened and Herzberg returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You perceive I expected you, Baron von Thugut,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;and I
      ordered here my minister of state, Herr von Herzberg. This is the Baron
      von Thugut, my dear minister, the ambassador of the empress-queen, who
      carries in his pocket peace or war, as it may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I must protest against being so important a personage, as peace and
      war alone depend upon your majesty. It alone depends upon the lofty King
      of Prussia whether he will give peace and tranquillity to Germany, or
      suffer the guilt of permitting the bloody scourge of civil war again to
      tear in pieces the unhappy German nation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds very sentimental,&rdquo; cried the king, smiling. &ldquo;The Baron von
      Thugut will appeal to my heart, when we have only to do with the head.
      Austria wishes to be the head of Germany, and as such would devour one
      German state after another, as a very palatable morsel. But if you will be
      the head, Monsieur le Baron, you cannot represent the stomach also, for,
      as I have been told, it only exists in those soft animals of the sea whose
      head is in their stomach, and which think and digest at the same time.
      Austria does not belong to this class, but has rather a very hard and
      impenetrable shell. We cannot let her devour as stomach what as the head
      she has chosen as booty. That the electorate of Bavaria is not to be
      devoured, is the necessary and fundamental preliminary upon which the
      temple of peace may be erected. If you, or rather the empress-queen, agree
      to it, the negotiations can be concluded by you two gentlemen. But if you
      think to erect a temple of peace upon any other basis, your propositions
      will be in vain. I have not taken the field to make conquests, but to
      protect the rights of a German prince, and not suffer others to
      appropriate a German state. I know, as you have said, that war is a bloody
      scourge for the nation; but, sir, we will not look at it in a sentimental
      light, and talk of civil war, when Austria herself compels us to take the
      field. Or, perhaps, you imagine to prove to my good Pomeranians, Markers,
      and my other German states, that the Croatians, Pandurians, Hungarians,
      Wallachians, Italians, and Polanders, are our German brothers, which
      imperial Austria opposes to us. I think this brotherhood may be traced to
      our common ancestor, Adam, and in this sense all wars are indeed civil
      wars. In any case war is a scourge for man, and I am convinced that the
      empress-queen would just as willingly spare her Croatians, Pandurians,
      Wallachians, and Galicians, as I all my German subjects collectively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Also your majesty&rsquo;s Polish subjects, as may be expected,&rdquo; added Baron von
      Thugut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Polish subjects are the minimum portion, and are about in proportion
      to the German population as in imperial Austria the German is to the
      foreign. But enough of this; if I do not recognize this as a civil war, it
      is indeed a great misfortune. I would do every thing to avoid it&mdash;every
      thing compatible with the honor and glory of my house, as well as that of
      Germany in general. Therefore let us know the Views of the empress-queen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; answered Von Thugut, as he slowly untied and unfolded the
      documents, &ldquo;I beg permission to read aloud to your majesty the acts
      relative to these points.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, baron,&rdquo; answered the king quickly, &ldquo;the more minute details give to
      my minister; I wish only the contents in brief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At your majesty&rsquo;s command. The empress-queen declares herself ready to
      renounce the concluded treaty of inheritance to the succession of Bavaria
      at the death of Elector Charles Theodore; also to give up the district
      seized, if Prussia will promise to resign the succession of the Margraves
      of Anspach and Baireuth, and let them remain independent principalities,
      governed by self-dependent sovereigns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means, that Austria, who will unjustly aggrandize herself by
      Bavaria, will deprive Prussia of a lawful inheritance!&rdquo; cried the king,
      his eyes flashing anger. &ldquo;I will not heed the after-cause, but I wish to
      satisfactorily understand the first part of the proposition, that Austria
      will cede her pretensions to Bavaria.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, upon conditions only which are sufficient for the honor, the
      wishes, and necessities of my lofty mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear, my dear Herzberg,&rdquo; said the king, smiling, and turning to his
      minister, &ldquo;c&rsquo;est tout comme chez nous. It will now be your task to find
      out these conditions, which too closely affect the honor of one or the
      other. For this purpose you will find the adjacent Cloister Braunau more
      convenient than my poor cabin. At the conferences of diplomats much time
      is consumed, while we military people have little time to spare. I shall
      move on with my army.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, then! will your majesty break up here?&rdquo; cried Thugut, with evident
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled. &ldquo;Yes, I shall advance, as my remaining might be construed
      equal to a retreat. The arts of diplomacy may drag on until the
      imperialists have assembled all their foreign subjects to the so-called
      civil war. Then hasten the negotiations, Baron von Thugut, for every day
      of diplomatic peace is one day more of foraging war, and I know not that
      you count the Bohemians in the German brotherhood, to whom the calamity of
      war is ruinous. You have now to deal with the Baron von Thugut, my dear
      Herzberg, and I hope the baron will accept some diplomatic campaigns with
      you in Cloister Braunau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I accept, and if your majesty will dismiss me, I will go at once to
      the cloister,&rdquo; answered Baron von Thugut, whose manner had become graver
      and more serious since the king&rsquo;s announcement of the intended advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are at liberty to withdraw. The good and hospitable monks have
      already been apprised of your arrival by an express courier, and have
      doubtless a good supper and a soft bed awaiting you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had your majesty the grace to be convinced of my return?&rdquo; asked Thugut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was convinced of the tender heart of the empress-queen, and that she
      would graciously try once more, in her Christian mercy, to convert such an
      old barbarian and heretic as I am. Go now to the cloister, and when I pass
      by in the morning, with my army, I will not fail to have them play a pious
      air for the edification of the diplomats&mdash;such as, &lsquo;My soul, like the
      young deer, cries unto Thee,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Oh, master, I am thy old dog,&rsquo; or some
      such heavenly song to excite the diplomats to pious thoughts, and
      therewith I commend you to God&rsquo;s care, Baron von Thugut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king charged Herr von Herzberg to play the role of grand-chamberlain,
      and accompany the ambassador to his carriage, smiling, and slightly
      nodding a farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron was on the point of leaving, when the king called to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had your majesty the grace to call me?&rdquo; asked Thugut, hastily turning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; answered Frederick, smiling, and pointing to the string which had
      served to bind the baron&rsquo;s papers. &ldquo;You have forgotten something, my lord,
      and I do not like to enrich myself with others&rsquo; property.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote:
      Historical. The king&rsquo;s words.&mdash;See Hormayr.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Baron von Thugut took this last well-aimed stab of his royal opponent
      somewhat embarrassed, and hastened to pick up the string, and withdraw.

      CHAPTER XX. THE KING AND THE LOVER.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king smiled, glancing at the retreating figure of the baron, and
      approached the window to peep through the little green glass panes to see
      him as he passed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sly fox,&rdquo; said he, smiling, &ldquo;but I will prove to him that we understand
      fox-hunting, and are not deceived by cunning feints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will your majesty really break up to-day?&rdquo; asked Von Herzberg, upon
      returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear minister. That is to say, I do not wish to, but I must, in
      order to give the negotiations for peace a war-like character. The enemy
      asks for delay to finish their preparations for war&mdash;not peace. The
      negotiations for the latter emanate from the empress, but the conditions
      concerning Anspach come from the emperor. It is the Eris-apple, which he
      casts upon the table, by which his imperial mother and I would gladly
      smoke the pipe of peace. It is incumbent upon you, Herzberg, to negotiate
      for peace, while I pick up the apple and balance it a little upon the
      point of my sword. I shall leave early to-morrow, but I would speak with
      you before I set out. You must be weary with the journey, so rest awhile
      now, then dine with me, and afterward go to the conference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, will you not receive my protege, Conrector Moritz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not say that he begged for a secret audience?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire, he has for this purpose travelled the long distance from
      Berlin, and I assure your majesty, upon my word of honor, that I have not
      the least suspicion what his petition may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh bien, say to your protege that I grant him the sought-for interview on
      your account, Herzberg. You are such a curious fellow&mdash;you are always
      petitioning for others instead of yourself, and the benefits which you
      ought to receive go to them. Let Moritz enter, and then try to sleep a
      little, that you may be wide awake to confer with Baron von Thugut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Minister von Herzberg withdrew, and immediately the pale, earnest face of
      Conrector Philip Moritz appeared in the royal presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king regarded him with a prolonged and searching glance, the noble,
      resolute face of whom was pallid with deep grief, but from whose eyes
      there beamed courageous energy. &ldquo;Are you the translator of the chapters
      from Tacitus, which my Minister Herzberg handed me?&rdquo; asked the king, after
      a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; gently answered Moritz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am told that it is ably done,&rdquo; continued his majesty, still attentively
      observing him. &ldquo;You will acknowledge that it is exceedingly difficult to
      render the concise style of Tacitus into the prolix, long-winded German?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sire,&rdquo; replied Moritz, whose youthful impetuosity could with
      difficulty be diverted from the real object of his pilgrimage. &ldquo;Our
      language is by no means long-winded, and there is no difficulty in
      translating Latin authors into German, which equals any living tongue in
      beauty and sonorousness, and surpasses them all in depth of thought,
      power, and poesy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diable!&rdquo; cried the king, smiling; &ldquo;you speak like an incarnate German
      philologist, who confounds the sound of words with profound thought. You
      will acknowledge that until now our language has not been much known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; answered Moritz, &ldquo;Martin Luther, in his translation of the Bible
      three hundred years since, employed hundreds of beautiful, expressive
      formations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is not only a learned man,&rdquo; said the king to himself, &ldquo;but he seems an
      honorable one; and now, as I have proved his scholarly attainments, I must
      indulge his impatience.&rdquo; The king&rsquo;s penetrating glance softened, and his
      features changed their severe expression. &ldquo;The Minister von Herzberg
      informed me that he found you by the roadside, and that you would journey
      hither on foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you travel in that manner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I desired, as the poor, heavily-laden pilgrims of the middle ages,
      to make the pilgrimage to the Holy Father at Rome, who was the king of
      kings. Every step in advance seemed to them to lighten their burden and
      enhance their happiness. Your majesty is in our day what the pope was held
      to be in the middle ages, therefore I have wandered as a pilgrim to my
      king, who has the power to bind and to loose, and from whom I must not
      only implore personal happiness, but that also of a good and amiable young
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! it concerns a love-affair. As I now look at you, I can understand
      that. You are young and passionate, and the maidens have eyes. How can I
      help you in such an adventure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, by not granting a title to a certain person, or if it must be
      granted, annul the conditions attendant upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; answered the king, harshly. &ldquo;Speak not in
      riddles. What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;General Werrig von Leuthen has addressed himself to you, sire, praying
      for the consent of your majesty to the marriage of his daughter with the
      banker Ebenstreit. Your majesty has consented, and added that Herr
      Ebenstreit shall take the name of his future father-in-law, and the
      marriage shall take place as soon as the title of nobility has been made
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king nodded. &ldquo;For which the new-made nobleman has to pay a hundred
      louis d&rsquo;ors to the Invalids at Berlin. But what is that to you? And what
      connection has Herr Ebenstreit&rsquo;s title to do with Conrector Moritz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moritz&rsquo;s face brightened, and, deeply moved, he answered: &ldquo;Sire, I love
      the daughter of General von Leuthen, and she returns my love. By not
      ennobling Ebenstreit, it lies in your power, most gracious majesty, to
      make two persons the most blessed of God&rsquo;s creatures, who desire nothing
      more than to wander hand in hand through life, loving and trusting each
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked the king, with a searching glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moritz quailed beneath it, and cast down his eyes. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;As I
      now stand in the presence of your majesty, I am sensible of the boldness
      of my undertaking, and words fail me to express what is burning in my
      soul. Oh! sire, I only know that we love each other, and that this love is
      the first sunbeam which has fallen upon my gloomy and thorny path of life,
      and awakened in my lonely heart all the bloom of feeling. You smile, and
      your great spirit may well mock the poor human being who thinks of
      personal happiness, when for an idea merely thousands are killed upon the
      field of battle. My life, sire, has been a great combat, in which I have
      striven with all the demons escaped from Pandora&rsquo;s box. I have grown up
      amid privations and need. I have lived and suffered, until God recompensed
      my joyless, toiling, hungered existence by this reciprocated love, which
      is a beautiful ornament to my life, and is life itself, and to renounce it
      would be to renounce life. I am young, sire, and I long for the unknown
      paradise of earthly happiness, which I have never entered until now, and
      which I can only attain led by the hand of my beloved. I yearn just once,
      as other privileged men, to bask in the sunshine of happiness a long,
      beautiful summer day, and then at the golden sunset to sink upon my knees
      and cry, &lsquo;I thank Thee, O God, that in Thy goodness I have recognized Thy
      sublimity, and that Thou hast revealed thy glory to me.&rsquo; All this appears
      of little importance to your majesty, for the heart of a king is not like
      that of other men, and the personal happiness of individuals appears a
      matter of little account to him who thinks and works for the good of an
      entire nation. But the fly, sire, which is sunning itself upon the plumes
      of the helmet of a victorious king, has its right to happiness, for God
      created it with the same care and love that He created the noblest of His
      creatures&mdash;man! and it would be cruel to kill it without necessity.
      Sire, I do not extol myself. I know that in your eyes I am no more than
      the fly upon your helmet, but I only implore you to grant me my life, for
      God has given it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean by this that I shall forbid General von Leuthen to marry his
      daughter to the rich man who seeks her, and to which marriage, understand
      me well, I have already given my consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I only know that this union drives not only me to despair, but one
      of the noblest and best of God&rsquo;s creatures. Fraulein von Leuthen does not
      love the bridegroom forced upon her; she detests him, and she has good
      reason to, for the banker Ebenstreit is a cold-hearted, purse-proud man,
      enfeebled by a voluptuous, vicious life, and seeks nothing nobler and more
      elevated in the young girl to whom he has offered his hand, than the title
      and noble name which she can procure for him. Your majesty, I implore not
      for myself, but for the daughter of a man who once had the good fortune to
      save your life in battle! Have pity upon her, and do not sacrifice her to
      an inconsolably hopeless life by the side of an unloved and detested
      husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king slowly shook his head. &ldquo;You forget that the general to whom I am
      indebted for this favor has begged my consent to this marriage, and that I
      have granted it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I conjure you to recall it! Upon my knees I implore you not to
      grant it! Do not make two people unhappy, who only beg of your majesty the
      permission to love and live with each other!&rdquo; Moritz threw himself at the
      king&rsquo;s feet, praying with clasped hands, his face flushed with deep
      emotion, and his eyes dimmed with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise!&rdquo; commanded Frederick, &ldquo;rise, do not kneel to me as to a God. I am a
      feeble mortal, subject to the same ills which threaten you and the whole
      human race. Rise, and answer me one question&mdash;are you rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Moritz, proudly raising his head; &ldquo;no, I am poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that Fraulein von Leuthen is poor? Her father is worse off
      than Job, for he is in debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If General von Leuthen&rsquo;s daughter were rich, or even moderately well off,
      I never would have presumed to address your majesty on the subject, for
      fear that you might misconstrue my intentions, and suppose that my love
      was inspired by self-interest. Fortunately, Marie possesses nothing but
      her noble, beautiful self. She leads a joyless existence under the severe
      discipline of her cold-hearted parents; and therefore I can truthfully
      say, that with me she will lose nothing, but gain what she has never known&mdash;a
      tranquil, happy life, protected by my love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much salary do you receive as teacher?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Majesty, as conrector of the college attached to the Gray Monastery,
      three hundred and fifty dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect to live upon that yourself, and support a family besides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I shall earn money in other ways, as I have already done. I shall
      write books. The publishers tell me that I am a favorite author, and they
      pay me well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If on the morrow you should fall ill, your income would vanish, and your
      family and you would starve together. No! no! you are an idealist, you
      dream how life should be, and not as it is in truth! I have listened to
      you, thinking that you would present some forcible argument upon which to
      found your pretensions, but I hear only the ravings of a lover, who
      believes the world turns upon the axis of his happiness. Let me tell you
      that love is an ephemera, which merrily sports in the sunlight a few short
      hours, and dies at sunset. Should a king forfeit his word for such a
      short-lived bliss? Should he reward a man to whom he is indebted by
      depriving him of a rich son-in-law, who is agreeable to him, and
      substituting a poor one, from whom he can never hope to receive a
      comfortable maintenance? You young people are all alike. You think only of
      yourselves, and it is a matter of little consequence to you if the aged
      pine away and die, provided you build up happiness on their graves! I ask
      you, who have talked so much about your own wishes, and those of your
      beloved, where is it written that man must be happy, that there is a
      necessity to make him so? Do you suppose that I have ever been happy&mdash;who
      have a long, active life in retrospection? Mankind have taken good care
      that I should not sip this nectar of the gods, and have taught me early to
      renounce it. Life is not consumed in pleasure, but in toil, and I believe
      its only happiness consists in the fact that at last, when weary and worn,
      we will sink into the grave&mdash;to an eternal rest! Every human being
      must work according to his abilities, and in the position which Fate has
      assigned to him. To maintain this position, his honor is at stake&mdash;the
      best and most sacred gift confided to man. You will not desert it&mdash;not
      despair in life because your dream of bliss is not realized.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; answered Moritz, with a cry of anguish, &ldquo;it is no dream, but a
      reality!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happiness is only ideal,&rdquo; said the king, slowly shaking his head. &ldquo;What
      we sigh for to-day, we curse on the morrow as a misfortune. Let this serve
      as a lesson to you. Toil on&mdash;you are a scholar; woo Science for your
      bride. Her charms will never fade. In youth as in old age she will attract
      you by her beauty and constancy&mdash;that which you cannot hope for from
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; asked Moritz, in deep dejection, &ldquo;will you not grant the petition
      of my heart? Will you condemn this poor, innocent young girl who prays
      your majesty through me, to a long, joyless existence, to a daily-renewing
      sorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;I have already said that happiness is
      imaginary; I might have added unhappiness also. General von Leuthen&rsquo;s
      daughter will accustom herself to the misfortune of being a rich man&rsquo;s
      wife, and finally will drive with a smiling face in her four-in-hand
      gilded carriage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I swear to you that you mistake this dear, noble-hearted young
      girl, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Enough!&rdquo; interrupted the king. &ldquo;I have given my consent to General von
      Leuthen, and I cannot recall it. Moreover, the marriage of the daughter of
      my general with you would be a misalliance&mdash;ridiculous. In the
      republic of intellect and science, you may have a very high position, but
      in my earthly kingdom you hold too modest a one to presume to raise your
      eyes to a noble young lady. I regret that I can offer you no other
      consolation than to listen to reason, and be resigned. As we cannot bring
      down the moon to earth, we must content ourselves with a lamp to light up
      our small earthly abode. If this ever should fail you, then come to me and
      I will assist you. I cannot, to be sure, give you the moon, for that
      belongs as little to me as the bride of the rich Herr Ebenstreit von
      Leuthen. One cannot give away that which one does not possess. Farewell!
      return to Berlin, and resign yourself bravely to your fate. Accustom
      yourself to the thought that in fourteen days Fraulein von Leuthen will
      become the wife of your wealthy rival. The wedding ceremony awaits only
      the papers of nobility, for which my order has already been forwarded to
      Berlin. I moreover propose to you not to return to the college at once,
      but travel for two weeks. I will be responsible for your absence, and
      provide you with the necessary means. Now tell me whether you accept my
      proposal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to your majesty, I cannot,&rdquo; answered Moritz, with calm dignity.
      &ldquo;There is but one balm which my king could grant me. Money is not a
      plaster to soothe and heal a wounded heart. Sire, I beg you to dismiss me,
      for I will return at once to Berlin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that you have not the foolish idea to return on foot,&rdquo; said the
      king. &ldquo;My courier will leave in an hour, and there are two places in the
      coupe, accept one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Moritz, gloomily, &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; suddenly the words died on his
      lips, and his eyes beamed with an unnatural fire, which paled under the
      observing glance of the king. &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said Moritz, gasping, &ldquo;I will
      accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king nodded. &ldquo;Au revoir, in Berlin! When I return after the campaign I
      will send for you. You will then have learned to forget your so-called
      misfortune, and smile at your pilgrimage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot think so, sire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am convinced of it. Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moritz answered the royal salutation with a mute bow, and withdrew with
      drooping head and sorrowful heart. The king continued to regard him with
      an expression of deep sadness. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;how enviable are those
      who can still believe in love&rsquo;s illusion, and who have not awakened from
      their dream of bliss by sad experience or age! How long since I have
      banished these dreams&mdash;how long I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king ceased, his head sank back upon his chair, his large, fiery eyes,
      peering into the distance, as if he would re-people it with the memories
      of youth, with the delusions from which he had so long awakened. Those
      lovely, charming forms flitted before him one by one which had then
      captivated him: the beautiful Frau von Wrechem, his first love, and to
      whom he had vowed eternal constancy; another sweet, innocent face that
      suffered shame and degradation for him&mdash;&ldquo;oh! Doris, Doris, dream of
      my youth, fly past!&rdquo;&mdash;and now the face with the large eyes and
      energetic features, which turned so tenderly to him, that of his sister
      Frederika, who from affection to the crown prince had sacrificed herself
      to an unloved husband in order to reconcile the son with the father, and
      preserve for him the inheritance to the throne; still another calm and
      gentle face, with the expression of sorrowful resignation in the deep-blue
      eyes, that of his wife, who had so passionately loved him, and had faded
      away at his side unloved! All past&mdash;past. A new face arose, the
      pretty Leontine von Morien, the tourbillon of the princely court at
      Rheinsberg, who pined away in sighs. Now passed the sweetest and loveliest
      of all. The king&rsquo;s eyes, which stared into empty space, now beamed with
      glad recognition. The heart which had grown old and sobered beat with
      feverish rapidity, and the compressed lips whispered, sighing,
      &ldquo;Barbarina!&rdquo; She stood before him in her bewitching beauty, with the
      charming smile upon her ruby lips, and passionate love beaming from her
      flashing eyes. &ldquo;Oh, Barbarina!&rdquo; The king rose, a cold chill crept over
      him. He looked around so strangely in the desolate, darkened room, as if
      he could still see this form which greeted him with the sad smile and
      tearful glance. No one was there. He was quite alone. Only the feeble echo
      of far-distant days repeated the device of his youth&mdash;of his life:
      &ldquo;Soffri e taci! Resignation alone has remained true to me. But no&mdash;there
      is still another friend, my flute. Come, you faithful companion of my
      life! You have witnessed my sorrows, and from you I have nothing to
      conceal!&rdquo; He tenderly regarded it, for it was long since he had taken it
      from its case. The sorrows and cares of life, the suffering from the gout
      which raged in his teeth, and sad, sobering old age, had caused him to lay
      it aside, but with the habit of affection he carried it everywhere.
      Frederick felt himself grow young again with the souvenirs of former days,
      and essayed to recall the echo of tenderer feelings upon his flute. The
      music of his heart was hushed, the melodious tones of former days would
      not return. The king laid it aside with an impatient movement. &ldquo;Nothing is
      lasting in life,&rdquo; he murmured. A flourish of trumpets, a peal of drums
      announced that the regiment was passing which would parade before the
      king. What are they playing, which rouses the lonely king with bright
      memories and shouts of victory? It is the march which his majesty composed
      after the brilliant victory of Hohenfriedberg. The king raised his eyes
      gratefully to heaven, repeating aloud: &ldquo;There is something lasting in
      life. Love ceases and music dies away, but the good we have accomplished
      remains. The most glorious of earthly rewards is granted to those who have
      achieved great deeds&mdash;the mortal becomes immortal&mdash;the gods
      ceding to him that which is more elevating than love or happiness&mdash;fame.
      Ye trumpets of Hohenfriedberg, ye will still quiver when I am gone, and
      relate to succeeding generations about &lsquo;Old Fritz.&rsquo; Such tales are well
      worthy to live and suffer for! I am coming, ye trumpets of fame.&rdquo; With
      youthful activity and beaming face the king went out to receive his
      generals, who saluted him with silent reverence, and his soldiers, who
      greeted their beloved commander and king with an exultant shout.

      CHAPTER XXI. IN WEIMAR.
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There lies dear Weimar, encircled in its wreath of green. Do you not see
      it, Wolf? I will refresh my heart with its view; so halt, postilion,
      halt,&rdquo; cried the duke. &ldquo;It is more beautiful to me than stately, proud
      Berlin. Though a poor, gray nest, I could press it to my heart, with all
      its untidy little houses, and tedious old pedants. Let us walk down the
      hill, Wolf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most willingly,&rdquo; cried Goethe, stretching forth his arms to the little
      town, nestled in the peaceful valley, &ldquo;be welcome, you lovely paradise,
      with your angels and serpents; we press on toward you with all our heart
      and soul, as to the seven-sealed book, filled with mysteries, and we would
      draw glorious revelations from your hidden contents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And grant, ye gods, that the inspired one may at last break the seal
      which a cruel friend has placed upon her lips, that he may not drink the
      kiss of love glowing beneath,&rdquo; said the duke, smiling. &ldquo;Do you not see the
      gray roof yonder, with its background of tall trees, that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house where dwells my beloved, my dearest friend, my sister, and the
      mistress of my heart,&rdquo; interrupted Goethe. &ldquo;She is all this, for she is my
      all in all. The fountains of bliss and love which here and there I have
      drawn from, refreshing my heart and occupying my mind, flow toward her,
      united in one broad, silvery stream, with heaven and earth mirrored
      therein, and revealing wonderful secrets in its rushing waves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Wolf!&rdquo; cried the duke, &ldquo;you are a happy, enviable creature, free and
      unfettered, sending your love where it pleases you. My dear Wolf, I advise
      you never to marry, for&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe hastily closed the duke&rsquo;s mouth with his hand. &ldquo;Hush! not a word
      against the noble Duchess Louisa, my master and friend. She is an example
      of refined, womanly dignity; and you, Charles, are to be envied the love
      of so estimable a wife and sweet mother for your children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I am,&rdquo; cried the duke, enthusiastically. &ldquo;I could not have found a
      more high-minded, lovely wife, or a more excellent, virtuous mother for my
      descendants. But you know, Wolf, that your Charles has still another
      heart, very susceptible and tender, which seeks for an affinity to call
      its own, and vent itself in the pleasures of youth, in glorious
      flirtations, melancholy signs, and blissful longings. You cannot expect me
      at twenty-two to play the grandfather, and have no eyes or heart for other
      captivating women, though I love my young wife most affectionately, and
      bless Fate that I am bound with silken cords to Hymen&rsquo;s cart&mdash;though
      I am forever bound, and you, Wolf, are happily free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because grim Fate refuses to unite me to my beloved. Oh, Charlotte, if
      you were free, how blessed would I be, enchained by you! Not to &lsquo;Hymen&rsquo;s
      cart,&rsquo; as the fortunate mocker says, but to the chariot of Venus, drawn by
      doves, enthroned upon which you would bear me to heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not blaspheme, Wolf,&rdquo; cried the duke; &ldquo;rather kneel and thank the gods
      that you are not fettered and your wings clipped. They wish to preserve to
      you love&rsquo;s delusion, because you are a favorite, and deny you the object
      adored. Beware of the institution which the French actress, Sophie
      Arnould, has so wittily called the &lsquo;consecration of adultery.&rsquo; You will
      agree with me that we have many such little sacraments in our dear Weimar,
      and I must laugh when I reflect for what purpose those amiable beauties
      have married, as not one of them love their husbands, but they all possess
      a friend besides.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The human heart is a strange thing,&rdquo; said Goethe, as they descended the
      hill, arm in arm, &ldquo;and above all a woman&rsquo;s heart! It is a sacred riddle,
      which God has given Himself to solve, and that only a God could unravel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant a flash of lightning, followed by heavy-rolling thunder,
      was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, Wolf&mdash;only hear!&rdquo; laughed Charles&mdash;&ldquo;God in heaven
      responds, and confirms your statement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or punishes me for my bold speech,&rdquo; cried Goethe, as the hailstones
      rattled around him hitting his face with their sharp points. &ldquo;Heaven is
      whipping me with rods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our carriage has descended with a quick trot into the valley,&rdquo; said
      the duke. &ldquo;I will call it.&rdquo; He sprang into the middle of the road, making
      a speaking-trumpet of his hands, and shouted in a full, powerful voice,
      &ldquo;Oho, postilion! here, postilion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The continued rolling of the thunder, the whistling wind, and rattling
      hail, made all attempts inaudible. The two gentlemen sought shelter under
      the thick crowns of the oak-trees by the wayside, which formed an
      impenetrable roof to the flood of rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing more sublime than a thunder-storm,&rdquo; said Goethe, looking
      up as if inspired; &ldquo;when the thunder rolls in such awful majesty and
      wrath, it seems as if I heard Prometheus in angry dispute with the gods.
      In the dark clouds I see the Titan, enveloped in mist, overspreading the
      heavens, and raising his giant-arm to hurl his mighty wrath.&rdquo; At this
      instant a flash of lightning, followed by a deafening peal reverberated in
      one prolonged echo through the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not hear him, Charles?&rdquo; cried Goethe, delighted&mdash;&ldquo;hear all
      the voices of earth united in the grumbling thunder of his wrath? See,
      there he stands, yonder in heaven&mdash;his form dark as midnight. I hear
      it&mdash;he calls&mdash;Overshadow the heavens, O Jupiter, With thy
      vaporous clouds! Cut off the oak and mountain-tops As a boy plucks the
      thistle. Leave me earth and my cabin Which thou hast not built, And my
      hearth-side, The glow of which thou enviest me! I know naught so miserable
      As you gods&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the mighty peal silenced Goethe, who looked to heaven with defiance
      flashing from his eyes and his clinched hand upraised, as if he were
      Prometheus himself menacing the gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Proceed, Wolf,&rdquo; cried the duke, as the echo died away. &ldquo;How can you,
      yourself a god, be so excited with the anger of like beings? Proceed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The uplifted arm of the poet sank at his side, and the fiery glance was
      softened. &ldquo;No human word is capable of expressing what Prometheus just
      spoke in thunder,&rdquo; said Goethe, musingly, &ldquo;and I humbly feel how weak and
      insignificant we are, and how great we think ourselves, while our voice is
      like the humming beetle in comparison to this voice from the clouds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be not desponding, Wolf, your own will ring throughout Europe; every ear
      will listen and every heart will comprehend, and centuries later it will
      delight with its freshness and beauty. The storm passes and dies away, but
      the poet lives in his heavenly melodies through all time. You must finish
      &lsquo;Prometheus&rsquo; for me, Wolf. I cannot permit you to leave it as a fragment.
      I will have it in black and white, to refresh myself in its beauty bright.
      A spark of your divine talent is infused into my soul, and I begin to
      rhyme. Ah, Wolf, all that is elevated within me I owe to you, and I bless
      Fate for according you to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also, dear Charles,&rdquo; said Goethe, feelingly. &ldquo;For, fostered and
      protected by your noble mind and nature, my inmost thoughts develop and
      blossom. We give and receive daily from each other, and so mingle the
      roots of our being that, God willing, we will become two beautiful trees,
      like the oak which now arches over us. But see, the rain is fast ceasing,
      and the sun looks out by the clinched hand of Prometheus. We can now
      travel on to the loved spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Wolf, are you in love? None but a lover could say the rain has
      ceased, when it pours down so that we should be drenched before we could
      arrive at Weimar. But hark! I hear a carriage in the distance; we may be
      favored with a shelter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The duke stepped out from under the trees, and looked along the highway
      with his sharp hunter&rsquo;s eye. &ldquo;A vehicle approaches, but no chance for us,
      as it appears to be a farm-wagon, crowded with men and women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it does,&rdquo; said Goethe, joining him; &ldquo;a very merry company they are
      too, singing gayly. Now, grant the rain rain has ceased&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charlotte von Stein is at Weimar,&rdquo; interrupted the duke. &ldquo;Give me your
      arm, and we will walk on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They advanced briskly arm in arm. A stranger meeting them would have
      supposed that they were brothers, so much alike were they in form,
      manners, and dress, for the duke as well as Goethe wore the Werther
      costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they descended, the carriage came nearer and nearer. The duke&rsquo;s keen
      eye had not been deceived. It was a farm-wagon, filled with a frolicsome
      party, sitting on bags of straw for cushions. They were chatting and
      laughing absorbed in fun, and did not observe the two foot-passengers, who
      turned aside from them. A sudden cry of surprise hushed the conversation;
      a form rose, half man and half woman, enveloped in a man&rsquo;s coat of green
      baize, crowned with a neat little hat of a woman. &ldquo;Oh, it is Charles!&rdquo;
       cried the form, and at the same instant the duke sprang to the wagon. &ldquo;Is
      it possible, my dear mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Duchess Amelia!&rdquo; cried Goethe, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed the duchess, greeting them with an affectionate look. &ldquo;The
      proverb proves itself&mdash;&lsquo;Like mother, like son.&rsquo; On the highway mother
      and son have met. You should have done the honors in a stately equipage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I be permitted to ask where you come from?&rdquo; asked the duke. &ldquo;And the
      dress, of what order do you wear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We walked to Ziefurt, and intended to walk back. Thusnelda is so delicate
      and weak, that she complained of her fairy feet paining her,&rdquo; answered the
      duchess, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, duchess, must I always be the butt?&rdquo; cried the lady behind the
      duchess, crouching between the straw-sacks. &ldquo;Must I permit you to follow
      in my footsteps, while I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Goechhausen&mdash;hush, sweet Philomel,&rdquo; interrupted the duke, &ldquo;or
      the Delphic riddle of this costume will be apparent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is easily explained,&rdquo; said the duchess. &ldquo;No other conveyance was to be
      had, and my good Wieland gave me his green overcoat to protect me from the
      pouring rain.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: True anecdote.&mdash;See Lewes&rsquo; &ldquo;Goethe&rsquo;s
      Life and Writings,&rdquo; vol. 1., p. 406.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And from to-day forth it will be a precious palladium,&rdquo; cried the little
      man with a mild, happy face on the straw by the duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is Knebel too,&rdquo; shouted the duke to the gentleman who just then
      pulled the wet hood of his cloak over his powdered hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our treasurer Bertuch, Count Werther, and Baron von Einsiedel also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does not your highness ask after our bewitching countess?&rdquo; asked
      Goechhausen, in her fine, sharp voice. &ldquo;The countess is quite ill&mdash;is
      she not, Count Werther?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so, they say so,&rdquo; answered the count, rather absent-minded. &ldquo;I
      have not seen her for some days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the duke, as Goethe was engaged in a lively
      conversation with the duchess. &ldquo;Is the dear countess dangerously ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered Goechhausen, &ldquo;not very ill, only in love with genius, a
      malady which has attacked us all more or less since that mad fellow
      Wolfgang Goethe has raged in Weimar, and made it a place of torment to
      honorable people. Oh, Goethe&mdash;oh, Wolf! with what lamb-like innocence
      we wandered in comfortable sheep&rsquo;s clothing until you came and fleeced us,
      and infected us with your &lsquo;Sturm und Dranger&rsquo; malady, and made us fall in
      love with your works!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goechhausen, hold your malicious tongue, and do not hide your own joy
      beneath jest and mockery,&rdquo; cried the duchess. &ldquo;Acknowledge that you are
      rejoiced to see your favorite, and that you will hasten to write to Madam
      Aja, &lsquo;Our dear duke has returned, and my angel, my idol, Wolfgang, also.&rsquo; 
      I assure you, Goethe, Thusnelda loves you, and was exceedingly melancholy
      during your absence. If asked the cause of her sadness, she wept like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a crocodile,&rdquo; said the duke. &ldquo;Oh, I know those tears of Fraulein
      Goechhausen; I could relate stories of her crocodile nature. Mother, how
      can you have such a monster in your society? Why not make the cornes, that
      the little devils may fly away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; cried the little, crooked lady. &ldquo;I see your highness has not
      changed by this journey. Where have you been, dear duke? Oh, I remember;
      you flew over the Rhine, and have flown home again quite unchanged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All laughed, the duke louder than any one. &ldquo;Goechhausen, you are a
      glorious creature, and the Arminius is to be envied who appropriates this
      Thusnelda. Oh, I see the charming youth before me, who has the courage to
      make this German wife his own!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will scratch his eyes out?&rdquo; cried Goechhausen, &ldquo;and then the Countess
      Werther can play Antigone, and lead him around as Oedipus. Why shut your
      eyes, Einsiedel? I do not scratch quite yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not thinking of that,&rdquo; said the baron, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never think that every one knows; but did you not do it so soon as
      you understood the Countess Werther should lead blind Oedipus as
      Antigone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the count could answer, the court lady turned again to the duke.
      &ldquo;What did your highness bring me? I hope you have not forgotten that you
      promised me a handsome present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not forgotten it; I have brought my Thusnelda a souvenir&mdash;such
      a gift!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, your highness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A surprise which, if Thusnelda is clever, she must think about all night.&mdash;But,
      Goethe, is it not time to leave the ladies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, I command you both,&rdquo; said the Duchess Amelia, extending her hand to
      her son, who pressed it to his lips most affectionately. &ldquo;I have given out
      invitations for a soiree, for this evening. My daughter-in-law, the
      Duchess Louisa, has accepted, duke, and Frau von Stein also, Goethe. I
      hope to see you at Belvedere, gentlemen. The poet Gleim is in town, and
      will read his late &lsquo;Muse Almanach.&rsquo; May I not expect both of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They joyfully consented, gazing after the merry society as it drove away.
      &ldquo;This is a good bite for the poisonous tongues of the honorable,&rdquo; cried
      the duke. &ldquo;My mother in a farm-wagon, with Wieland&rsquo;s green overcoat on,
      and the reigning duke, with his Goethe, entering his capital on foot like
      a journeyman mechanic, after a long journey!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish we were there, my dearest friend,&rdquo; sighed Goethe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, love makes you impatient! Come on, then. But listen, we must play
      Gochhausen a trick; I have promised her a surprise. Will you help me,
      Wolf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With pleasure, duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought of something very droll, and your servant Philip must help
      us; he is a clever fellow, and can keep his own counsel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is silent as the grave, duke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is necessary for such a gentleman as the women all run after. Let us
      skip down the mountain, and then forward where our hearts incline us. This
      afternoon I will go for you and bring you to Belvedere, and then we can
      talk over the surprise.&rdquo; They ran down the declivity into the suburb, to
      the terror of the good people, who looked after them, saying that the
      young duke had returned with his mad protege. The &ldquo;mad favorite&rdquo; seemed
      more crazy than ever to-day, for after a brief farewell to the duke, he
      bounded through the streets across the English park, to the loved house,
      the roof of which he had so longingly greeted from the hillside. The door
      stood open, as is customary in small towns, and the servant in the
      vestibule came to meet him, and respectfully announced that her master had
      gone to his estate at Hochberg, but that Frau von Stein was most probably
      in the pavilion, in the garden, as she had gone thither with her guitar.
      &ldquo;Is she alone?&rdquo; asked Goethe. The servant answered in the affirmative, and
      through the court hastened the lover&mdash;not through the principal
      entrance, as he would surprise her, and read in her sweet face whether she
      thought of him. Softly he opened the little garden gate, and approached
      the pavilion by a side-alley. Do his feet touch the ground, or float over
      it? He knew not; he heard music, accompanied by a sweet, melodious voice.
      It was Charlotte&rsquo;s. Goethe&rsquo;s face beamed with delight and happiness. He
      gazed at her unseen, not alone with his eyes, but heart and soul went
      forth to her. She sat sideways to the door; upon a table lay her notes,
      and the guitar rested upon her arm. She sang, in a rich, sweet voice,
      Reinhardt&rsquo;s beautiful melody:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather fight my way through sorrows Than bear so many joys in life;
      All this affinity of heart to heart, How strangely it causes us to
      suffer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, as if overpowered with her own thoughts, the guitar sank upon
      her lap, and her fingers glided over the chords, so that the tones died
      away imperceptibly. Her deep-blue eyes gazed pensively in the distance,
      and the sweet lips repeated softly, &ldquo;How strangely it causes us to
      suffer!&rdquo; Near the garden entrance, through which the odor of sweet flowers
      and the song of birds was wafted with every gentle zephyr, stood Goethe,
      looking at the woman whom he had so passionately loved for three years, so
      absorbingly, that to her were consecrated all his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could contain himself no longer; he rushed forward and threw himself at
      her feet. &ldquo;Oh, Charlotte, I love you, only you, and once more I am by your
      side!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shriek! was it a cry of surprise or delight? Who let the guitar fall to
      the floor, he or she? Who embraced the other in affectionate haste, he or
      she? Who pressed the lips so lovingly to the other lips, he or she? And
      who said, &ldquo;I love you? What bliss to again repose in your affection, I
      would fain die now. In this moment a whole life has been consecrated, for
      love has revealed to us our other self.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat upon the tabouret, and Goethe still knelt before her, clasping her
      feet and pressing them to his bosom. His eyes beamed with inexpressible
      delight as he regarded the face, usually so calm and indifferent&mdash;today
      glowing as sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, tell me, Charlotte, have you thought of me? But rather speak to me
      with your eyes, and may they be more than the cruel lips which refuse to
      confess. Oh, shade not those loved orbs, which are my stars shining upon
      me, whithersoever I wander. They are my light, my spring-time, and my
      love. They will never cease to beam upon me, as light and love never grow
      old. Let me read eternal youth in those eyes, and the secrets which rest
      as pearls in the depths of your heart. Only tell me, is the pearl of love
      to be found there, and is it mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a misfortune if it were there,&rdquo; she whispered, with a sweet
      smile. &ldquo;Pearls are the result of a malady, and my heart would be ill if
      the pearl of love were found there. No, no, rise, Wolf, dear Wolf, we have
      given away at the first moment of meeting; let us now be reasonable, and
      speak in a dignified manner with each other, as it becomes a married woman
      and her friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend?&rdquo; repeated Goethe, impetuously; &ldquo;forever must I listen to this
      hated, hypocritical word, which, like a priest&rsquo;s robe, shall cover the
      sacred glow in my heart? I have told you, Charlotte, that I am not your
      friend, and I never shall be. There is not the least spark of this still,
      calm fire of the earthly moderation in me, by which one could cook his
      potatoes, or his daily vegetables, but by which one could never prepare
      food for the gods, or that which could refresh a poet&rsquo;s heart or quicken
      his soul. No, in me burns the fire which Prometheus stole from the gods,
      originating in heaven and glowing upon earth. This heavenly and earthly
      love unites in one flame. Again, I say, Charlotte, banish this
      hypocritical word &lsquo;friendship!&rsquo; It is only love which I feel for you, let
      this sentiment enter at every avenue of your heart, and do not feign
      ignorance of it, sweet hypocrite. Surprise has torn away the mask! The
      passionate kiss, which still burns upon my lips, was not given by a friend
      or sister; but overcome by joy, the truth has been acknowledged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wish that the kiss of meeting should be that of parting also?&rdquo;
       said Charlotte, sadly, as she raised her blue eyes with a languishing look
      to the handsome, ardent face of the man who stood before her. &ldquo;Do you wish
      to separate forever? I must recall to you our last conversation: &lsquo;Only
      when you are resolved to moderate this impetuous manner, and curb this
      overflow of feeling, which reason and custom imposes upon us, shall I be
      able to receive you and enjoy your society.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with these unmeaning phrases you banished me. Cruel and hard-hearted
      were you to the last. Oh, Charlotte! you know what I suffered at our last
      walk, with your reasoning remonstrances and cold-hearted reproaches; they
      pierced my heart like poisoned arrows. If the duke and duchess had not
      been walking before us, I should have wept myself weary. My whole being
      cried within me: &lsquo;Oh! cruel and inexorable woman, to beg of me, who so
      unutterably loves her, to call her friend and sister!&rsquo; I repeated the
      words daily during my absence, and sought to clothe your beloved image
      with meaning. They disfigured you, and the angel whom I adore was no
      longer recognizable. I cannot call you friend or sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I can be nothing to you, dear Wolfgang,&rdquo; sighed Charlotte. &ldquo;In this
      hour of meeting we will part, and to avoid a chance encounter even, I will
      go to my husband at Kochberg, and remain there the whole summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe seized her, holding her fast in his strong arms, staring her in the
      face with a fierce, angry look. &ldquo;Are you in earnest? Would you really do
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Goethe, I beg you to loosen your hold; you hurt my arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not also hurt me? With your cold indifference do you not pierce my
      heart with red-hot daggers, and then smile and rejoice at my torture,
      which is a proof to you of my unbounded love? While you only play with me,
      and attach me to your triumphal car, to display to the world that you have
      succeeded in taming the lion, and have changed him into a good-natured
      domestic animal. Go! you do not deserve that I should love you,
      cold-hearted, cruel woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw her arms from him, with tears in his eyes. Charlotte von Stein
      regarded him with anger and indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, secretary of legation. It seems to please you to insult and
      offend a poor woman, who has no other protection than her honor and
      virtue. Farewell! I will not expose myself to such offences; therefore I
      will retire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned slowly toward the door, but Goethe bounded forward like a
      tiger, interrupted her path, falling upon his knees, imploring pity and
      begging for pardon. &ldquo;Oh, Charlotte, I will be gentle as a child, I will be
      reserved, I know that I am a sinner! It is warring against one&rsquo;s own heart
      to seek comfort in offending what is dearest to it in a moment of
      ill-humor. But I have again become a child, with all my thoughts, scarcely
      recognizable for the moment, quite lost to myself, as I consent to the
      conditions of others with this fire raging within me. Oh, beloved
      Charlotte, forgive me! I submit to all that you wish.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote:
      Goethe&rsquo;s words.&mdash;See &ldquo;Letters to Charlotte von Stein,&rdquo; roll., p. 358.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be satisfied to love me as your friend and sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Only in the future you must endeavor to persuade
      yourself into such a sisterly way that you will be indulgent to my
      rudeness, otherwise I shall have to avoid you when I need you most. Oh,
      Charlotte, it seems terrible to me that I should mar through anguish the
      best hours of my life, the blissful moments of meeting with you, for whom
      I would pluck every hair from my head if it would make you happy. And yet
      to be so blind, so hardened! Have pity upon me. Again I promise you that I
      will be reasonable. Do not banish me from your presence. Extend to me your
      hand, and promise me that you will be my friend and sister!&rdquo; <i>[Footnote:
      Goethe&rsquo;s words.&mdash;See &ldquo;Letters to Charlotte von Stein,&rdquo; roll., p. 358.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then here is my hand,&rdquo; said she, with a charming smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be your friend and sister, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now, my Charlotte? do finish&mdash;what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid her hand gently upon his shoulder, and her words fell on his ear
      like soft music. &ldquo;When my dear friend and much-beloved brother has
      conducted himself very prudently for two or three happy weeks, I will send
      him a ringlet of my hair, which he has so long begged for, and a kiss with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe spoke not, but pressed her blushing face to his bosom, and laid his
      hand gently upon her head. A smile of delight&mdash;of perfect happiness&mdash;played
      around his lips.

      CHAPTER XXII. THE READING.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This happy smile still beamed upon Goethe&rsquo;s face as he walked with the
      duke late in the evening toward Belvedere to soiree of the Duchess Amelia,
      who was inspired with a love for the fine arts, and particularly
      literature. The two gentlemen had busily occupied themselves in preparing
      them for the lady of honor, Fraulein von Gochhausen, and, although aided
      by Goethe&rsquo;s servant, Philip, and workmen, it was late when they arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered, the ladies and gentlemen were seated in a large circle
      around the centre-table. At one end sat the Duchesses Amelia and Louisa,
      the mother and wife of Charles Augustus and near the former her friend and
      favorite the poet Wieland, once the tutor of her son the duke. Near the
      poet sat an elderly gentleman of cheerful, good-natured mien, who, with
      the exception of Wieland, was the only one who did not present himself,
      like the duke and Goethe, in Werther costume. He wore a white,
      silver-embroidered coat, with a dark-blue satin vest, and breeches of the
      same, shoes with buckles, and bosom and wrist ruffles of lace.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman, with the bright, sparkling eyes, and pleasant face, was
      the poet Gleim, who looked very comfortable and stately in the circle of
      powdered perukes. His admiration for Frederick the Great had inspired him
      to write some beautiful military songs, and his love of poetry and
      literature made him an enthusiastic admirer of all those devoted
      themselves to literary pursuits. Besides, he was rich and liberal, and it
      was very natural that the poets, and authors exerted themselves with
      marked assiduity to please Father Gleim. They were gratified to have him
      print their works for a small remuneration in an annual which he entitled
      the &ldquo;Almanach of the Muses.&rdquo; He was just reading aloud at the duchess&rsquo;s
      soiree from the late edition of the almanach, and the society listened
      with earnest and kind attention, occasionally interrupted with an
      enthusiastic &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Excellent!&rdquo; from the duchess, followed by a
      murmur of assent around the table, which caused the poet&rsquo;s face to
      brighten with joy and satisfaction, and him to read on with increased
      energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The entrance of the duke and Goethe was unobserved, as it was understood
      that the former wished no notice to be taken of his going or coming, and
      the duchess had also waved her hand, not to interrupt Father Gleim. The
      poet has just finished the new poem of melodious rhythm of imprisoned
      Shubart. As he paused to wipe the perspiration from his brow and sip a
      little raspberry water, a tall, slender young man, in the Werther costume,
      approached, bowing, and regarding the poet so kindly, that the glance of
      his fine black eyes fell like a sunbeam on the heart of the old man. &ldquo;You
      appear somewhat fatigued, my good sir,&rdquo; said the unknown, in a sweet,
      sonorous voice. &ldquo;Will you not permit me to relieve you, and read in your
      stead from this glorious book of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so, my dear Gleim,&rdquo; said the Duchess Amelia, smiling, &ldquo;you seem really
      exhausted; let the young man continue the agreeable and welcome
      entertainment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Father Gleim was very well pleased; he handed the book to the young
      stranger with a graceful bow, as the latter seated himself opposite to
      him, and next to Fraulein Gochhausen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He commenced in a clear, distinct voice. The verses flowed from his lips
      gracefully, and in a cultivated style. The company listened with devoted
      attention, and Father Gleim, the protector of all the young poets, sat
      delighted, nodding consent, with a pleasant smile. It must all be charming&mdash;it
      had come into existence under his fostering care. What beautiful verses to
      listen to! &ldquo;Die Zephyre lauschen, Die Balche rauschen, Die Sonus
      Verbreitet ihr Licht mit Wonne!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And how charmingly the young man read them! Suddenly Father Gleim
      startled, and the smile died upon his lips. What was it? What was the
      young man reading? Verse which were not in the collection, and which were
      more remarkable than he had ever heard from his young poets. &ldquo;Those are
      not in the Annual,&rdquo; cried Gleim, quite forgetting decorum,&mdash;&ldquo;that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One glance from the fine black eyes of the young man so confounded Father
      Gleim, that he ceased in the midst of a sentence, and, staring in
      breathless astonishment, listened. Glorious thoughts were expressed
      therein, and the poets of the Muse Almanach might have thanked God if the
      like had occurred to them. Love was not the burden of the song; neither
      hearts, griefs, nor bliss, but satire, lashing right and left with
      graceful dexterity, and dealing a harmless thrust to every one. All were
      forced to laugh; the happy faces animated and inspired every thing. The
      brilliant satirical verses rushed like rockets from the lips of the reader&mdash;a
      real illumination of wit and humor, of good-natured jokes and biting
      sarcasm, and it delighted the old man that every one had received hits and
      thrusts but himself; he had been spared until now! Every one regarded him,
      smiling and amused, as the reader exalted the merits of the Maecenas, and
      praised him highly for the interest he took in the poet&rsquo;s heart, soul, and
      purse, and shouted victory when one excelled. But suddenly the good father
      also changed, and, instead of the patron on the right throne, there was a
      turkey-cock on the round nest, which zealously sought to hatch out the
      many eggs that he had to take care of for others besides his own; he sat
      brooding untiringly, and shed many a tear of joy over the fine number of
      eggs, yet it happened that a poetical viper had put but under him one of
      chalk, which he cared for with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Gleim could no longer contain himself, and, striking the table, he
      cried, &ldquo;That is either Goethe or the devil!&rdquo; The entire company burst into
      uncontrollable laughter, and the old man shouted the second time, though
      inwardly angry, &ldquo;It is either Goethe or the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both, dear Father Gleim,&rdquo; said Wieland, who was drying his tears from
      laughter, &ldquo;it is Goethe, and he has the devil in him to-day. He is like a
      wild colt, which kicks out behind and before, and it would be well not to
      approach him too near.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: Wieland&rsquo;s own words.&mdash;See
      Lewes&rsquo; &ldquo;Life of Goethe,&rdquo; vol. i., p. 432.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Goethe alone retained his composure, and continued reading in a louder
      voice, which hushed all conversation. He lashed with bitter sarcasm &ldquo;him
      who assumed to be a god&mdash;a wise man&mdash;and who counted for nothing
      better than a pretentious, saucy fellow, who made himself the scorn of the
      poets by his sweet, Werther-like sighs, and other worthless lamentations,
      heeding neither God nor the devil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so he stormed and thundered, ridiculed and slandered his own flesh and
      blood, until Goechhausen, red with anger, rose and snatched the book from
      his hand, and closed his lips with her hand, crying: &ldquo;If you do not cease,
      Goethe, I will write to your beloved mother, Frau Aja, that a satirist, a
      calumniator has had the impudence to defame and slur her beloved son in a
      most sinful and shameful manner! I will write to her, indeed, if you do
      not stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe rose, and bowing offered his hand to Father Gleim in such a
      friendly, affectionate manner, that the old man, quite delighted, thanked
      him heartily for the pleasure and surprise which he had afforded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke, however, seated himself by the little lady of honor. &ldquo;Thusnelda,
      you are an incomparable creature, and quite calculated to be the
      ancestress of all the Germans. I declare myself your cavalier for the
      evening, and will devote myself to you as your most humble servant, and
      will not quit your side for a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very beautiful it will be, my dear duke, a most charming idyl; in true
      Watteau style, I will be the sweet shepherdess, and lead your highness by
      a little ribbon. But where is my present&mdash;my surprise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not be impatient, Thusnelda, but wait what time will produce.
      You will have it; if not to-day, to-morrow. Every day brings its own care
      and sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, duke, instead of giving me my surprise, you beat me with doggerels.
      That comes from having a Goethe for companion and friend. Crazy tricks,
      like chicken-pox, are contagious, and the latter you have caught, duke. It
      is a new kind of genius distemper. Very fortunately, our dear Countess
      Werther has another malady, or she might be infected. Perhaps she has it
      already, Count Werther&mdash;how is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know, Fraulein,&rdquo; replied the count, startled from reverie. &ldquo;I
      really do not know! My wife is quite ill, for that reason has gone to our
      estate to recover her peace and quiet. It is unfortunately quite
      impossible for me to visit her there; but my dear, faithful friend, Baron
      von Einsiedel, will drive over to-morrow at my request, my commission&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To set the fox to keep the geese,&rdquo; interrupted Thusnelda in her lively
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that, Fraulein,&rdquo; said Count Werther, quite confused, as the duke
      burst into a merry laugh, calling Thusnelda a witty Kobold, and as her
      faithful Celadon offered her his arm to conduct her to his mother, the
      Duchess Amelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The company were all in a very happy frame of mind. Goethe&rsquo;s charming
      impromptu had kindled wit and humor upon every lip. He himself was the
      happiest of all, for Charlotte was by his side, gazing upon him with her
      large, thoughtful eyes, and permitting him to be her cavalier for the
      evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke also devoted himself to Fraulein von Goechhausen, who was this
      evening unsurpassably witty and caustic, delighting him, and making the
      Duchess Amelia laugh, and the Duchess Louisa sometimes to slightly shrug
      her shoulders and shake her head with disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of a most interesting conversation with Frau von Stein,
      Goethe was informed that some one awaited him in the anteroom. He went out
      quickly, and upon returning he whispered to the duke, who nodded, and
      answered him in a low tone, and then Goethe betook himself to the Duchess
      Amelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the latter asked. &ldquo;Have important dispatches arrived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I come to your highness as courier from your son. The duke begs that
      you will lock the door of your anteroom when you retire, and that you will
      upon no condition open it, no matter how much Thusnelda may beg and
      implore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not injure my poor Goechhausen, you wanton fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! it is not very dangerous, duchess. It is only a harmless surprise,
      which the duke promised Fraulein von Goechhausen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, it can take place; I promise to be quite deaf to all
      Thusnelda&rsquo;s knocking and thumping, and I shall be glad to be informed
      to-morrow what the trick is. I prefer not to inquire to-day, as I might
      feel obliged to veto it if it were too severe. But look, the Duchess
      Louisa will break up; does she know any thing about the affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, your highness, you know very well that the young duchess&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is much more sensible than the old one, and shakes her head
      disapprovingly when she hears of your ingenuous tricks. Perhaps it would
      be well if I were equally sensible, but there is no help for it. I like
      bright, happy people, and I think when youth vents itself, old age is more
      sedate and reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite right, duchess. Mankind resembles new wine. If the must
      does not ferment and foam well, no good wine will come of it. But look at
      our Charles, with the saucy jest upon his lip, and the fire of inspiration
      in those bright brown eyes. One day a fine, strong wine will clear itself
      from this glorious fermenting must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so, Goethe, and if the gods grant it, the great merit will belong
      to you, who have proved yourself a good vintager, and we will rejoice
      together in your glorious success.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIII. WITCHCRAFT
    </h2>
    <p>
      An hour later the palace Belvedere was silent and deserted; the guests had
      taken their departure. The duchess had her suite and commanded them to
      retire. Fraulein von Gochhausen alone remained with her mistress, chatting
      by the bedside, and recapitulating in her amusing style all important and
      unimportant events of the soiree, The duchess smiled at the mischievous
      remarks with which she ornamented her relation, and at her keen,
      individualizing of persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fraulein Gochhausen, you are the most wicked and the merriest
      mocking-bird God ever created,&rdquo; cried the duchess, &ldquo;Have done with your
      scandals, go up to your room, piously say your evening prayers, and
      stretch yourself upon your maiden bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Soon, duchess; only one thing more have I to call your attention to.
      There is a gossip afloat about the Werthers. I perceive it in the air, as
      the dove scents the vulture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You alarm me, Gochhausen; what good is it? You do not mean that the
      lovely Countess Werther&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is not only very weary of her husband, but looks about for a substitute&mdash;a
      friend, as the ingenious ladies now call him. That is what I mean, and I
      know the so-called friend which the sweet sentimental countess has
      chosen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Baron von Einsiedel, is it not?&rdquo; asked the duchess. &ldquo;That is to
      say, his younger brother, the gay lieutenant, not our good friend par
      excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I mean the brother, and I have warned and taunted the count this
      week past, but it is impossible to awake him from his stupidity and
      thoughtlessness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again you are giving loose reins to your naughty tongue, Thusnelda. Count
      Werther is a thoroughly scholarly person, whom I often envy his knowledge
      of the languages. He has studied Sanscrit and the cuneated letters, among
      other ancient tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be that he understands the dead languages, but the living ones not
      in the least. The language of the eyes and inspiration he is blind to,
      with seeing eyes! My dear duchess, if you are not watchful, and prevent
      the affair with timely interference, a scandal will grow out of it, and
      you know well that it would be a welcome opportunity for our Weimar
      Philistines (as the Jena students call commonplace gossips) to cry
      &lsquo;Murder,&rsquo; and howl about the immoral example of geniuses, which Wolfgang
      Goethe has introduced at court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the duchess, musingly; &ldquo;your apt tongue and keen eye
      are ever carefully watching, like a good shepherd-dog, that none of the
      sheep go astray and are lost. And you do not mind attacking this or that
      one in the leg with your sharp teeth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let those scream who are unjustly bitten, your highness! Believe me, the
      countess will not cry out; she will much more likely take care not to
      receive a well-merited rebuke. I beg your grace to prevent the gossip! Not
      on account of this silly, sentimental young woman, or her pedantic
      husband, but that our young duke and Goethe may not be exposed to scandal,
      as well as your highness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right&mdash;we must take care to prevent it. Has not the countess
      been absent at her estate four days?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your highness, it is just this that troubles me. She went away as
      sound as a fish, and has suddenly fallen very ill. No physician has been
      called, but, to-morrow, the count will commission his dear friend the
      baron to drive to his country-seat, and bring him tidings of his
      better-half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must circumvent this. In the morning we will arrange a pleasure-drive,
      of the whole court, to the country-seat of Count Werther. It shall be a
      surprise. Let Fourier give out the invitations early to-morrow, for a
      country party, destination unknown. The distribution of the couples in the
      carriages shall be decided by lot. Take care that Lieutenant Einsiedel is
      your cavalier, so that when we arrive at the little Werther, he will
      already be appropriated, and then we will induce her to return with us and
      spend some time at Belvedere. Now, good-night, Thusnelda; I am very tired
      and need repose. Sleep already weighs upon my eyelids, and will close them
      as soon as you are gone. Good-night, my child&mdash;sleep well!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little deformed court lady kissed the extended hand, the candlestick,
      with only a stump of a taper in it, and withdrew from the princely
      sleeping-room, courtesying, and wishing her mistress good-night, with
      pleasant dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The anteroom was dark and deserted. The lights were all extinguished, and
      Fraulein Goechhausen was, in truth, the only person who had not long since
      retired in the ducal palace. She was accustomed to be the last, accustomed
      to traverse the long, lonely corridors, and mount two flights of stairs to
      her bedroom upon the third story. The gay duchess, being very fond of
      society, had had the second story arranged guest-chambers and
      drawing-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should the little court lady be afraid to-night? She had not thought
      of it, but stepped forward briskly to mount the stairs. It was surely very
      disagreeable for the wind to extinguish her lamp at that instant, just at
      the turning of stairs, and she could not account for it, as none of the
      windows were open, and there was no trace of a draft. However, it was an
      undeniable fact, the light was out and she was in total darkness&mdash;not
      even a star was to be seen in the clouded sky. It was, indeed, true that
      Thusnelda was so accustomed to the way that it mattered little whether she
      had a light or not. Now she had reached the corridor and she could not
      fail to find the door, as there was but one, that of her own room. She
      stretched out her hand to open it, but, strange to say, she missed the
      knob! Then she was sure that it was farther on; she felt along the wall,
      but still it eluded her grasp. It was unheard of&mdash;no handle and not a
      door even to be found! The wall was bare and smooth, and papered the
      entire length. A slight shudder crept over the courageous little woman&rsquo;s
      heart, and she could not explain to herself what it all meant. She called
      her maid, but no answer&mdash;not a sound interrupted the stillness! &ldquo;I
      will go down to the duchess,&rdquo; murmured Thusnelda; &ldquo;perhaps she is awake,
      and then I can re-light my taper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was fastened; the duchess had locked the ante-room to-night for
      the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thusnelda tapped lightly, and begged an entrance humbly and imploringly.
      No answer, every thing was quiet. She recalled that the duchess had told
      her that she was very weary, and would sleep as soon as she was alone,
      which she undoubtedly had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thusnelda did not presume to awake her by knocking louder. She would be
      patient, and mount again to her room. Surely she must have made a mistake,
      and turned to the left of the corridor, where there was no door, instead
      of the right, as she ought to have done. It must be that it was her fault.
      She groped along the dark flights of stairs to the upper gallery,
      carefully seeking the right this time, but in vain. Again she felt only
      the smooth wall. Terrified, she knew not whether she was awake or
      dreaming, or whether she might not be in an enchanted castle, or walking
      in her sleep in a strange house. Just here she ought to find her room and
      the maid awaiting her, but it was lonely, deserted, and strange&mdash;no
      door, no maid. Thusnelda, with trembling hands smoothed her face, pulled
      first her nose, and then her hair, to identify herself. &ldquo;Is it I?&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Am I, indeed, myself? Am I awake? I know that I am lady of honor to
      the Duchess Amelia, and that upon the upper story is my room. Do not be
      foolish, and imagine that witchcraft comes to pass; the door is there, and
      it can be found.&rdquo; Thusnelda renewed her search with out-spread arms and
      wide-spread fingers, feeling first this side of the wall and then the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      By daylight the deformed little lady of honor must have been a very droll
      figure, in full toilet, dancing along the wall as if suspended by her
      outstretched hands. Oh, it was quite vain to seek any longer. It must be
      enchantment, and the door had disappeared. An indefinable dream crept over
      Thusnelda, and she was cast down. For the first time a jest failed her
      trembling lips, and she wept with anguish. Yes, she, the keen, mordant,
      jesting little woman, prayed and implored her Maker to unloose her from
      the enchantment, and permit her to find the long-sought-for entrance. But
      praying was in vain, the door was not to be found, it was witch craft, and
      she must submit to it. The rustling and moving her arms frightened her
      now, and when she walked the darkness prevented her seeing if any one
      followed her; so she crouched upon the floor, yielding to the unavoidable
      necessity passing the night there&mdash;the night of enchantment and
      witchery.<i>[Footnote: See Lewes&rsquo; &ldquo;Life and Writings of Goethe,&rdquo; vol. 1.,
      p. 408.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Not alone for Fraulein Goechhausen was this beautiful May-night of sad
      experience with witches. There were other places at Weimar. In the
      neighborhood of the ducal park, in the midst of green-meadows, stood a
      simple little cottage. Near it flowed the Ilm, spanned by three bridges,
      all closed by gates, so that no one could reach the cottage without the
      occupant&rsquo;s consent. It was as secure as a fortress or an island of the
      sea, and distinctly visible even in the night, its white walls rising
      against the dark perspective of the park. This is the poet&rsquo;s Eldorado, his
      paradise, presented to Wolfgang Goethe by his friend the Duke Charles
      Augustus. It was late as the possessor wound his way toward his Tusculum,
      as he familiarly called it, and, more attracted by the aspect of the
      heavens than by sleep, sought the balcony, to gaze at the dark mass of
      clouds chasing each other like armies in retreat and pursuit; one moment
      veiling the moon, at another revealing her full disk, and soon again
      covering the earth with dark shadows, until the lightning flashed down in
      snaky windings, making the darkness momentarily visible with her lurid
      glare. It was a glorious spectacle for the intuitive, sympathetic soul of
      the poet, and he yielded to its influence with delight. He heard the voice
      of God in the rolling of the thunder, and sought to comprehend the
      unutterable, and understand it in this poetical sense. Voices spake to him
      in the rushing of the storm, the sighing of the trees, and the rustling of
      the foliage. The storm passed quickly, a profound quiet and solemnity
      spread out over the nightly world, and it lay as if in repose, smiling in
      blissful dreams. The air was filled with perfumes, wafted to the balcony
      upon which dreamed the poet with unclosed eyelids and waking thoughts. The
      clouds were all dispersed; full and clear was suspended the moon in the
      deep, blue vault, where twinkled thousands of stars, whispering of unknown
      worlds, and the mysteries of Nature, and the greatness of Him who created
      them all.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&ldquo;Oh, beloved, golden moon, how calmly you look down upon me, sublime and
lovely at the same time! When I gaze at you, moving so quietly, floating
in infinity, and contemplating reflect thyself in finiteness, I think of
you, oh Charlotte, who stands above me like the moon so bright and mild,
and I envelop myself in your rays, and my spirit becomes heavenly in
your light.

     Mir ist es, denk ich nur an Dich,
     Als in den Mond zu seh&rsquo;n,
     Ein suesser Friede weht um mich,
     Weiss nicht, wie mir gescheh&rsquo;n!
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, like sweet peace, and quiet, sacred moonlight, my thoughts shall be
      of you, Charlotte; not like the glowing rays of the sun, or the cold light
      of the stars. Bright and beaming like the moon you are to me, spreading
      around me your soft light. Oh, beautiful golden moon, mirrored in the
      water, you lie as in a silvery bath, and would entice me to seek you in
      the murmuring depths. Hark! how the ruffled waves of the Ilm with repeated
      gentle caresses kiss the shore, rush from thence in golden links down the
      river! Sweet of the Ilm, I come, I come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Goethe hastened from the balcony, threw aside his apparel, plunged into
      the silvery flood, shouting with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What heavenly pleasure to float there, rocked by the murmuring waves,
      gazing at the silvery stars and the golden moon, a lovely May night,
      listening to the voices of Nature! Add to that the perfume-laden breeze
      rising from the rain-refreshed meadows. How glorious to plunge into the
      cool stream, splashing and dashing the water, and then to shoot like a
      fish through the drops falling like golden rain! Suddenly, while swimming,
      Goethe raised his head to listen. He thought he heard footsteps on the
      poet&rsquo;s forbidden bridge. The moon distinctly revealed a peasant from
      Oberweimar, who would be early to the weekly market, and so serve himself
      to the shortest route while no one could see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such presumption deserves punishment, my good peasant, and if there is no
      one else to do it the ghosts must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Listen, what a savage yell from under the bridge, and then another more
      unearthly!
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasant, frightened, stopped suddenly, and looked down into the river.
      &ldquo;Oh, what can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A glistening white arm is raised menacingly toward the bridge. A white
      figure, with a black head and long black hair, is seen plunging and
      splashing, while fearful yells are heard from the deep. Then it
      disappeared, to return, and menace, and yell, and plunge again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasant shrieked with terror, and was answered with a cruel laugh. The
      white figure sank and rose from the river screeching and yelling, and the
      peasant shrieked also with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A ghost! a ghost! oh, have mercy upon us! Amen! amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fright lent him wings, and he fled, followed by the savage yells of the
      white figure, and never stopped until he reached Oberweimar, where he
      related to the astonished and terrified neighbors that there was a
      river-ghost just by the bridge which led to the cottage of the mad
      secretary of legation, Goethe, and which howled in the moonlight.<i>[Footnote:
      This tradition of the ghost of the Ilm has been preserved in Weimar, since
      Goethe&rsquo;s nocturnal bath, until our time.&mdash;See Lewes, vol. i., p. 451.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the peasant also disappeared the ghost of the Ilm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a happy child of Nature, refreshed, Goethe went to his room and then
      again sought the balcony, to throw himself upon the carpet and gaze at the
      blue starry vault, and enjoy the glories of heaven with thoughtful
      devotion, and think of Charlotte&mdash;only of her, not once of the poor
      Thusnelda von Goechhausen, who passed the night upon the stairs of the
      Palace Belvedere, and who, at last weary with fright and exhaustion, fell
      asleep, and was awakened by the Duchess Amelia in the morning, laughingly
      demanding why she preferred the landing of the stairs for a place of
      repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I am bewitched, duchess, and my sleeping-room has disappeared
      from earth&mdash;because some cursed demon or wizard has enchanted me,
      this wicked&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beware what you say!&rdquo; interrupted the duchess; &ldquo;it is most probably the
      duke that you are inveighing against, and calling a demon and wizard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Thusnelda sprang up as if struck by an electric shock&mdash;&ldquo;The
      surprise, this is what the duke promised me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; laughed the duchess. &ldquo;The courier just arrived with a
      letter from my son to you, and I came to bring it myself, and found you,
      to my surprise, sleeping here. Read it, and tell me what he says!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, listen, your highness!&rdquo; cried Thusnelda, after having hastily perused
      the contents of the ducal missive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I hope I have succeeded to surprise you! Demons and wizards have closed
      your doors, And weeping you slept on the stairway alone. All witchcraft
      has now disappeared. Go seek The surprise that from Berlin I brought you,
      Which I now offer for an atonement.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An insolent fellow, indeed, is my son,&rdquo; said the duchess, &ldquo;but you see,
      Thusnelda, he says, pater peccavi, and I am convinced that you will find
      something very pretty and acceptable in your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not take it&mdash;indeed I will not,&rdquo; pouted the lady of honor.
      &ldquo;He so fearfully tormented me last night. I assure your highness I was
      half dead with terror and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you will forgive him, Thusnelda, for the duke is your declared
      favorite; you dare not reproach him were he never so insolent, for you are
      just as much so, and not a hair&rsquo;s-breadth better. Come, go up and see what
      it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went, and found four masons, who had been at work since daybreak to
      remove the wall and replace the door. Thusnelda was obliged to laugh in
      spite of the unhappy night she had passed, as she climbed over rubbish and
      ruins into her room, and met her maid dissolved in tears, who related to
      her that &ldquo;the duke had had her walled in, for fear she would tell the
      trick to her mistress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you were really hermetically sealed?&rdquo; said the duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your highness,&rdquo; whimpered the maid, &ldquo;I thought I never should see
      daylight again. I wept and prayed all night. The only thing that consoled
      me was the duke&rsquo;s command, which Philip brought to me, to give this little
      box to Fraulein so soon as the wall should be taken away in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me, Lieschen,&rdquo; cried Thusnelda, impatiently, her face beaming
      with satisfaction, however, when she opened the box. &ldquo;Now, duchess, that
      is what I call a surprise, and the duke shall be, as he ever has been, my
      favorite. If he does sometimes play rude tricks, he makes it all right
      again, in a very generous and princely manner. See what a beautiful watch
      his highness has brought me, ornamented with diamonds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is very pretty; give it to me that I may return it to the duke,
      and not mortify him too much, as you will not wear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will accept it, duchess,&rdquo; cried Thusnelda, laughing&mdash;&ldquo;and all is
      forgiven and forgotten.&rdquo;

      he not tell you about it?&rdquo;

      from him. I have been twenty times to the baker&rsquo;s in eight days, and
      waited at the corner of the street, where we agreed to meet, but no Moritz
      was there, and I have not been able to hear any thing about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something must have happened to him,&rdquo; sighed Marie. &ldquo;He is very ill,
      perhaps dying, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, my child, he is not ill, I will tell you all about it, if you
      will not worry. I have been to Herr Moritz&rsquo;s lodgings to-day. I could not
      wait any longer, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see him, and speak with him, Trude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No Marie, he was not there; and the people in the house told me that he
      had been gone for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; repeated Marie, thoughtfully. &ldquo;What does it mean? What could
      persuade him to abandon me in this hour of need? Tell me, Trude, what do
      you think? Console me if you can. You really know nothing further than
      that he is gone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little bit more, but not much, my heart&rsquo;s child. When the people told
      me that he had disappeared eight days ago, it seemed as if one of the Alps
      had fallen on my heart, and my limbs trembled so I could go no farther,
      and I was obliged to sit down upon the stairs and cry bitterly, picturing
      all sorts of dreadful things to myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadful things?&rdquo; asked Marie. &ldquo;Oh, Trude, you do not believe that my
      good, brave Moritz could do any thing sinful and cowardly, like wicked
      men? You do not think that my beloved&mdash;oh, no, no&mdash;I know that
      he is more noble; he will bear the burden of life as I will, so long as it
      pleases God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman hung down her head, and humbly folded her hands. &ldquo;Forgive
      me, my child, that I have such weak and sinful thoughts. I will apologize
      for them in my heart to you and your beloved so long as I live. After I
      had cried enough, I determined to go to the Gray Cloister, and beg the
      director to see me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see him to speak with him, dear good Trude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear child. I told him I was an aged aunt of Herr Moritz, who had
      come to Berlin to visit him; and finding that he was absent, I would like
      to know where he had gone, and, how long he would remain away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Trude, how clever you are, and how kindly you think of every thing!&rdquo;
       cried Marie, embracing her old nurse, and kissing affectionately her
      sunburnt, wrinkled cheek. &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me that Herr Moritz had begged permission to be absent fourteen
      days to take an urgent, unavoidable journey; that ten days had already
      expired, and he would soon return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he will be here in four days, and perhaps will bring hope and aid!
      He has gone to seek it; I know and I feel it, though I cannot divine where
      the assistance will come from. Oh, Trude, if I could only gain a favorable
      delay until Moritz returns!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every thing is arranged,&rdquo; murmured Trude. &ldquo;The marriage license is
      already made out, and Parson Dietrich has promised to be ready at any
      hour. Herr Ebenstreit has sent the money, doubling the amount required to
      the &lsquo;Invalids&rsquo; Hospital&rsquo; at Berlin, so that when the papers of nobility
      arrive, there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; interrupted Marie, &ldquo;do not speak of it. It is fearful to think of,
      and it crazes me to hear it. I will resort to every extreme. Since my
      father and mother are deaf to my entreaties, I will try to move him to
      pity. I have never been able to see him alone; my mother is watchful that
      an explanation should be impossible between us. I will implore this man to
      have pity upon me, and confide in him to whom they would sell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trude shook her head mournfully. &ldquo;I fear it will be in vain, dear child.
      This man has no heart. I have proved him, and I know it.&mdash;Hark the
      bell rings! Who can it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both stepped out of the little garret-room to peep over the banister.
      Since Marie had been betrothed to the rich banker Ebenstreit, the general
      had received from his kind wife a servant in pompous livery for his own
      service. This servant had already opened the door, and Marie heard him
      announce in a loud voice, &ldquo;Herr Ebenstreit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He!&rdquo; Marie started back with horror. &ldquo;He, so early in the morning! this
      is no accident, Trude. What does it mean? Hush! the servant is coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go down,&rdquo; whispered Trude; &ldquo;perhaps I can hear something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trude hurried away as her young lady glided back into her room, and never
      glanced at the servant who sprang past her upon the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a hypocrite and a spy; he has been hired to watch and observe my
      child, and he will betray her if he discovers any thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant announced, with respectful, humble mien, that Herr Ebenstreit
      had arrived, and Frau von Werrig desired her daughter to descend to the
      parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well&mdash;say that I will come directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant remained rubbing his hands in an undecided, embarrassed
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not go down?&rdquo; asked Marie. &ldquo;Have you any thing further to tell
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would say,&rdquo; said he, spying about the room, as if he were afraid some
      one were listening, &ldquo;that if a poor, simple man like myself could be
      useful to you, and you could confide in me your commissions, I should be
      too happy to prove to you that Carl Leberecht is an honest fellow, and has
      a heart, and it hurts his feelings to see the miss suffer so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said Marie, gently. &ldquo;I am glad to feel that you have
      sympathy for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can be of the least service to you, have the goodness to call me,
      and give me your commissions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will, although I do not believe it practicable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope miss will not betray me to Frau von Werrig or old Trude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I promise you that, and here is my hand upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The servant kissed the extended hand respectfully. &ldquo;I will enter into the
      service of my young lady at once, and tell her she must prepare for the
      worst: Herr Ebenstreit just said, &lsquo;The diploma of nobility has arrived.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie turned deadly pale, and for an instant it seemed as if she would
      sink down from fright, but she recovered herself and conquered her
      weakness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, it is very well that I should know that; I will go down
      directly,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      With calm, proud bearing Marie entered the sitting-room of her parents,
      and returned the salutations of her betrothed, who hastened toward her
      with tender assiduity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Marie,&rdquo; cried her mother, &ldquo;I have the honor to present to you
      Herr Ebenstreit von Leuthen. The certificate of nobility arrived this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I congratulate you, mother&mdash;you have at last found the long-desired
      heir to your name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Congratulate me above all, my beautiful betrothed,&rdquo; said Herr Ebenstreit,
      in a hoarse, scarcely intelligible voice. &ldquo;This title crowns all my
      wishes, as it makes me your husband. I came to beg, dear Marie, that our
      marriage should take place to-morrow, as there is nothing now to prevent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; she proudly interrupted him, &ldquo;have I ever permitted this familiar
      appellation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have allowed it,&rdquo; blurted out the general, packed in cushions in his
      roiling chair. &ldquo;Proceed, my dear son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter bowed with a grateful smile, and continued: &ldquo;I would beg, my
      dear Marie, to choose whether our wedding-journey shall be in the
      direction of Italy, Spain, France, or wherever else it may please her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it thus arranged?&rdquo; asked Marie. &ldquo;Is the marriage to take place early
      to-morrow, and then the happy pair take a journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered her mother, hastily, &ldquo;it is so decided upon, and it will
      be carried out. You may naturally, my dear daughter, have some preference;
      so make it known&mdash;I am sure your betrothed will joyfully accord it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will avail myself of this permission,&rdquo; she quietly answered. &ldquo;I wish to
      have a private conversation with this gentleman immediately, and without
      witnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how unfortunate I am!&rdquo; sighed Herr Ebenstreit. &ldquo;My dear Marie asks
      just that which I unfortunately cannot grant her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What should prevent your fulfilling my wish?&rdquo; asked Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My promise,&rdquo; he whined. &ldquo;On the very day of my betrothal, I was obliged
      to promise my dear mother-in-law never to speak with you alone or
      correspond with my sweet lady-love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are the rules of decency and of etiquette, which I hope my daughter
      will respect,&rdquo; said Frau von Werrig, in a severe tone. &ldquo;No virtuous young
      girl would presume to receive her betrothed alone or exchange love-letters
      with him before marriage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After the wedding there will be opportunities enough for such follies,&rdquo;
       grumbled the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may be sure that I shall use them, dear father,&rdquo; laughed Ebenstreit.
      &ldquo;I would beg my respected mother to release me a half-hour from my oath
      to-day, that I may indulge the first expressed wish that my future wife
      favors me with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible, my son. I never deviate from my principles. You will
      not speak with my daughter before marriage, except in the presence of her
      parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, do you insist upon it?&rdquo; cried Marie, terrified. &ldquo;Will you not
      indulge this slight wish?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;This slight wish!&rsquo;&rdquo; sneered her mother. &ldquo;As if I did not know why you
      ask this private conversation. You wish to persuade our son-in-law to what
      you in vain have tried to implore your parents to do. A modest maiden has
      nothing to say to her future husband, which her parents, and above all her
      mother, could not hear. So tell your betrothed what you desire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother, you must then take the consequences.&mdash;Herr Ebenstreit,
      they will force me to become your wife, they will sell me as merchandise
      to you, and you have accepted the bargain in good faith, believing that I
      agree to sacrifice my freedom and human rights for riches. They have
      deceived you, sir! I am not ready to give myself up to the highest bidder.
      I am a woman, with a heart to love and hate, who esteems affection
      superior to wealth. I cannot marry you, and I beg you not to teach me to
      hate you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A savage curse broke forth from the general, who, forgetting his gout,
      rose furious, shaking his clinched fist at his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife was immediately by his side, and pushed him into his arm-chair,
      commanding him, in her harsh, cold to remain quiet and take care of his
      health, and listen to what his son-in-law had to say to his unfeeling and
      unnatural daughter. &ldquo;He alone has to decide.&mdash;Speak, my dear son,&rdquo;
       said she, turning to the young man, who, with a malicious smile, had
      listened to the baroness, fixing his dull-blue eyes upon the young girl,
      who never seemed so desirable to him, as she now stood before him with
      glowing cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Again I say, speak, my dear son, and tell my daughter the truth; do you
      hear, the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will permit me, my dearest mother, I will,&rdquo; answered Ebenstreit,
      with submissive kindness, again regarding the daughter. &ldquo;You have made me
      a sad confession, Marie,&rdquo; said he, sighing, &ldquo;but I will acknowledge that I
      am not surprised, for your mother told me when I asked for your hand, that
      she feared I should never gain your consent, for you did not love me,
      although she herself, and the general, would grant theirs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that all that I told you?&rdquo; asked the mother, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not all,&rdquo; continued Ebenstreit, slightly inclining; &ldquo;you added, &lsquo;My
      daughter loves a beggar, a poor school-master, and she entertains the
      romantic idea of marrying him.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you reply?&rdquo; asked Marie, almost breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Marie, I laughed, repeating my proposal of marriage to your
      mother, saying, that I was ready to take up the combat with the poor
      pedagogue, and that you seemed all the more interesting and amiable for
      this romantic love. Life is so tedious and wretched, that one is glad to
      have some change and distraction. I assure you, I have not been so
      entertained for long years, as in the last fourteen days in this silent
      war with you. It amuses me infinitely to see you so stubborn and prudish,
      and increases my love for you. How could it be otherwise? The rich banker,
      Ebenstreit, has never seen a woman who was not ready to accept his hand,
      and why should he not love the first one who resists it? You have excited
      my self-love and vanity. You have made the marriage a matter of ambition,
      and you will comprehend that my answer is: &lsquo;Fraulein von Leuthen must and
      shall be my wife, no matter what it costs me. She defies my riches and
      despises money, so I will force her to respect my wealth and recognize its
      power. Besides, she is a cruel, egotistical daughter; who has no pity for
      her poor parents, and is capable of seeing them perish for her foolish
      attachment. I will make her a good child, and force her to make her
      parents, and thereby herself, happy.&rsquo; All this I said to myself, and I
      have acted and shall act accordingly. I have only to add that the ceremony
      will take place to-morrow, at eleven. We will leave immediately after.
      Have the goodness therefore to choose in which direction, that I may at
      once make the necessary arrangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lost&mdash;lost without hope!&rdquo; cried Marie, in anguish, covering her face
      with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rather say rescued from misfortune,&rdquo; answered Ebenstreit, quietly.
      &ldquo;Believe me, there is but one sorrow that may not be borne, may not be
      conquered, and that is poverty, which is a corroding, consuming malady,
      annihilating body, and soul, swifter and surer than the most subtle
      poison. It stifles all noble feelings, all poetical thoughts and great
      deeds, and, believe me, love even cannot resist its terrible power. One
      day you will understand this. I will be patient and indulgent, and await
      it with hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what a noble and high-minded man!&rdquo; cried the mother, with emphasis.&mdash;&ldquo;Marie
      should kneel and thank her Maker for such a magnanimous savior and lover,
      who will shield her from all evil and misfortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sobbing and sighing, the daughter had stood with her face concealed; now
      she regarded the cold-hearted, smiling woman, with flashing eyes and keen
      contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank him!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;no, I accuse, I curse him. He is an atheist, and
      denies love. He is not capable of a noble thought or action, scorning and
      defaming all that is beautiful and elevated, worshipping only mammon. I
      will never marry him. You may force me to the altar, and there I will
      denounce him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will kill me,&rdquo; cried the general; &ldquo;she will murder her aged parents,
      leaving them to starve and perish, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; commanded his wife. &ldquo;Leave off your complaints, she is not
      worth the tears or remonstrances of her parents. She would try to be our
      murderess, but she shall not.&mdash;My son, inform her of your decision.
      Answer her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The response to your romantic language is simple and natural, my dear
      Marie. I have already entered into your feelings, and am prepared for this
      idea of refusing your lover at the altar, which is found in novels, and I
      supposed that it might occur to you. Money compasses all things and
      according to our wishes. My fortune procures for me a dispensation from
      public authorities to be married here in the house of our dear parents.
      The law demands four witnesses, who will be represented by your parents,
      my servant Philip, and the sacristan whom the clergyman will bring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they will hear me abjure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very possible, dearest, but the witnesses will not listen to you.
      Money makes the deaf to hear, and the hearing ones deaf. Old parson
      Dietrich knows the story of your love, and believes, with us, that it is a
      malady that you must be cured of. Therefore, in pity to you, he will not
      listen, and the others are paid to keep silent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there no hope, O Heaven?&rdquo; cried Marie, imploringly. &ldquo;O God, Thou hast
      permitted it&mdash;hast Thou no pity in my need, and sendest me no aid?&rdquo;
       Rushing to her father, and kneeling at his feet, she continued: &ldquo;Have
      mercy upon your poor child! You are an old man, and may live but a few
      years; do not burden your conscience with the fearful reproaches of your
      only child, whom you will condemn to an inconsolably long and unhappy
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you no pity yourself? Do you not know that I, your father, am so
      poor, that I have not even the necessary care? You wish your parents to
      sacrifice themselves for you, and suffer want! No, the daughter should
      sacrifice herself for her parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful sacrifice, a fine sorrow!&rdquo; sneered her mother. &ldquo;She will be a
      rich woman, and have the most splendid house and furniture and most costly
      equipage in Berlin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a husband who adores her,&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit, &ldquo;and who will feel it
      his duty to make her and her parents happy. Resolve bravely to bury the
      past, and look the immutable future joyfully in the face. Eleven will be
      the happy hour; fear not that the altar will not be worthy the charming
      bride of such a rich family. Money will procure every thing, and I will
      send a florist who will change this room into a blooming temple, fit to
      receive the goddess of love. In your room you will find the gift of my
      affection, a simple wedding-dress, which I trust you will approve of. Oh,
      do not shake your head, do not say that you will never wear it; you must
      believe that all resistance is in vain. You will become my wife, I and my
      money will it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; cried Marie, standing before him pale and defiant, regarding him
      with unspeakable contempt, &ldquo;I and my love will it not. May God judge
      between us! May He forgive those who have brought this misfortune upon me!
      I can only say, &lsquo;Woe to them!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woe to you!&rdquo; cried her mother. &ldquo;Woe to the seducer who has persuaded our
      child to sin and crime, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush mother! I will not permit you to slander him whom I love, and ever
      shall, so long&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until you forget him, and love me, Marie,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit. Approaching
      her, he seized her hand, and pressed a kiss upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew it away with disgust, and turned slowly to the door, tossing back
      her head proudly. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; demanded her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her hand upon the knob, she replied, turning her pale, wan face to
      her mother, &ldquo;To my own room, which I suppose is permitted to me, as there
      is nothing more to be said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother would reply, and retain her, but her son-in-law held her gently
      back. &ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;she needs rest for composure and to accustom
      herself to the thought that her fate is unavoidable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what if she should resort to desperate means in her mad infatuation
      and foolish passion? Some one must watch her continually, for she may try
      to elope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, dearest mother, some one must be with her, in whom she
      will confide. Would it not be possible to win old Trude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing would gain her; she is a silly fool, who thinks only Marie is
      of consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;That means that she would sell herself
      at a high price. I beg that you will send for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see,&rdquo; said she, calling the old woman, who entered from the
      opposite door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trude looked about, scowling and grumbling. &ldquo;Leberecht told me my mistress
      called me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you then look so furious, and what are you seeking on the table?&rdquo;
       asked Frau von Werrig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My money,&rdquo; cried Trude, vehemently. &ldquo;I thought that you called me to pay
      me, and that my wages were all counted out on the table. But I see there
      is nothing there, and I fear I shall get none, and be poor as a
      church-mouse all my life long. Your honor promised me positively that, as
      soon as the wedding was decided upon, you would pay me every farthing,
      with interest, and I depended upon it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have all, and much more than the general&rsquo;s wife promised you,
      if you will be a true and faithful servant to us,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I always have been, and ever shall be,&rdquo; snarled Trude. &ldquo;No person
      can say aught against me. Now, I want my money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And obstinate enough you have been too,&rdquo; said her mistress. &ldquo;Can you deny
      that you have not always taken my daughter&rsquo;s part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not deny it. I have nursed her from childhood, and I love her as my
      own child, and would do any thing to make her happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe, Trude,&rdquo; cried the general, &ldquo;that Marie could be happy
      with that poor, starving wretch of a school-master? Has she not
      experienced in her own home the misfortune and shame of poverty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it well,&rdquo; sighed the old one, sadly, &ldquo;and it has converted me to
      believe that it would be a great misfortune for Marie to marry the poor
      school-master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, will you then faithfully help us to prevent it?&rdquo; quickly asked
      Ebenstreit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I do it?&rdquo; she sighed, shrugging her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can persuade my daughter to be reasonable, and yield to that which
      she cannot prevent. You are the only one who can make any impression upon
      Marie, as she confides in you. Watch her, that in a moment of passionate
      desperation she does not commit some rash act. You can tell us, further,
      what she says, and warn us of any crazy plan she might form to carry out
      her own will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, I must betray my Marie?&rdquo; cried Trude, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not betray, but rescue her. Will you do it?&rdquo; asked Ebenstreit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to be paid my wages, my two hundred thalers, that I have honestly
      earned, and I will have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit took a piece of paper from his pocket. Writing a few lines with
      a pencil, he laid it upon the table. &ldquo;If you will take this to my cashier
      after the ceremony to-morrow, he will pay you four hundred thalers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred thalers in cash,&rdquo; cried Trude, joyfully clapping her hands.
      &ldquo;Shall all that beautiful money be mine, and&mdash;No, I do not believe
      you,&rdquo; she cried, her face reassuming its gloomy, suspicious look. &ldquo;You
      promise it to me to-day, that I may assist you, and persuade Marie to the
      marriage, but to-morrow, when old Trude is of no more use, you will send
      me away penniless. Oh, I know how it is. I have lived long enough to
      understand the tricks of rich people. I will see the cash first&mdash;only
      for that will I sell myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old woman pleases me,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit. &ldquo;She is practical, and she is
      right.&mdash;If I promise you the money in an hour, will you persuade
      Marie to cease her foolish resistance, and be my wife? Will you watch over
      her, and tell us if any thing unusual occurs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four hundred thalers is a pretty sum,&rdquo; repeated Trude, in a low voice to
      herself. &ldquo;I might buy myself a place in the hospital, and have enough left
      to get me a new bed and neat furniture and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here her voice was lost in unintelligible mumbling, and, much excited, she
      appeared to count eagerly. With her bony forefinger she numbered over the
      fingers of her left hand, as if each were a fortune that she must verify
      and examine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother and the banker regarded each other with mocking looks; the
      general looked at the money, grumbling: &ldquo;If I had had four hundred thalers
      the last time I played, I could have won back my money in playing again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old woman,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit, &ldquo;have you not finished with your reckoning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, with an exultant laugh, &ldquo;I have done! Four hundred
      thalers are not sufficient. I must have five, and if you will give them to
      me in cash in an hour, then I will do every thing that you wish, and
      persuade Marie to the marriage. I will watch her day and night, and tell
      you every thing that she says and does. But I must have five hundred in
      cash!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit turned his dull-blue eyes to Frau von Werrig with a triumphant
      smile. &ldquo;Did you not tell me the old woman could not be bought? I knew that
      I was right. You did not offer her money enough; she will sell herself
      dear as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as dear as she can,&rdquo; laughed Trude&mdash;&ldquo;five hundred is my price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall have it in cash in an hour,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit, in a friendly
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much money,&rdquo; whined the general; &ldquo;it would have saved me if I had had
      it that last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son-in-law, I must confess you are exceedingly generous,&rdquo; remarked the
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No sum would be too great to assure me my bride. Go now, Trude, you shall
      have the money in time.&mdash;Will you allow me, father, to send your
      servant to my office for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send Leberecht here, Trude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman hurried out of the room, but the door once closed, her
      manner changed. One might have supposed a sudden cramp had seized her,
      from her distorted face, and twitching and panting, and beating the air
      with her clinched fists, and her quivering lips uttering broken words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approaching footsteps warned her to assume her general manner and
      expression, and cease her manipulations. &ldquo;The ladies and gentlemen wish
      you in the parlor,&rdquo; mumbled Trude to the servant descending the stairs.
      &ldquo;But where have you been, and what have you to do up there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was looking for you, lovely one&mdash;nothing more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now you have found me, tell me what you want? I know you were
      sneaking about, listening, because you thought I was with Marie. I
      understand you better than you think I do. I have found many a viper, and
      I am familiar with their aspect. Go! they are waiting for you, and let me
      find you again spying about, and I will throw a pail of water on you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this friendly assurance Trude dismissed Leberecht, and hastened with
      youthful activity to the little garret-room, when Marie fell upon her
      neck, weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Calm yourself&mdash;do not weep so&mdash;it breaks my heart, my dear
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And mine cannot break. I must endure all this anguish and survive this
      shame. Help me, my good mother, stand by me! It is impossible for me to
      marry that dreadful man. I have sworn constancy to my beloved Moritz, and
      I must be firm, or die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Die? then you will kill me!&rdquo; murmured the old one, &ldquo;for, if you go, I
      must go also. But we will not give up yet, as we are both living; we will
      not despair for life. I am going once more to Moritz&rsquo;s lodgings; it may be
      he has returned, and will rescue you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do, good Trude; tell him that I have courage and determination to
      risk and bear every thing&mdash;that I will await him; that nothing would
      be too difficult or dangerous to serve to unite me to him! Tell him that I
      prefer a life of poverty and want by his side, to abundance and riches in
      a splendid palace with that detested creature&mdash;but no, say nothing
      about it, he knows it well! If he has returned, tell him all that has
      happened, and that I am resolved to brave the utmost, to save myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go, dear child, but I have first my work to do, and enough of it
      too&mdash;but listen to what they have made me become.&rdquo; Hastily, in a low
      voice, she related to Marie the story of her corruption, excited as
      before, her limbs shaking and her fists clinched. &ldquo;They say we old women
      resemble cats, but from to-day forth I know that is a shameful lie! If I
      had possessed their nature and claws, I should have sprung at the throat
      of this rascal, and torn out his windpipe; but, instead of that, I stood
      as if delighted with his degrading proposal! Oh, fie! the good-for-nothing
      kidnapper would tempt a poor creature! Let us wait, they will get their
      reward. He shall pay me the five hundred thalers, and then this trader of
      hearts shall recognize that, however much ill-earned money he may throw
      away, love and constancy are hot to be bought. We will teach him a
      lesson,&rdquo; and with this, the old servant ceased, gasping for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go now, Trude, and learn if he has returned; upon him depends my
      happiness, and life even&mdash;he is my last hope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going, but first I would get the wages of my sin, and play the
      hypocrite, and tell a few untruths; then I will go to Moritz&rsquo;s lodgings,
      and the baker also. Do not despair; I have a joyful presentiment that God
      will have pity upon us and send us aid.&rdquo; Trude kissed and embraced her
      child, and scarcely waited an hour, when she was demanded in the parlor to
      receive her money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Ebenstreit was heartily delighted with her zealous impatience, and
      handed her ten rolls of gold, reminding her of the conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already consoled her a little, and she begins to change. I hope
      every thing will turn for good. Just leave her alone with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first, I must go and see my aged brother, who will take care of my
      money,&rdquo; replied Trude. &ldquo;He is a safe man and will not spend it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trude,&rdquo; cried the general, &ldquo;what an old fool! to seek at distance what is
      so near you. I will take your money, and give you interest. Do you hear? I
      will take care of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, general, I&rsquo;d rather give it to my brother, on account of the
      relationship.&rdquo; She slipped out of the room, hid the money in her bed, and
      hurriedly left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely an hour passed ere Trude returned as fleetly as she went. She
      cast only a look into the kitchen, and hastened up to Marie&rsquo;s room. Her
      success was evident in her happy, smiling face, and coming home she had
      repeated to herself, &ldquo;How happy Marie will be!&rdquo; almost the entire way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had but closed the door, when the mean little Leberecht glided from
      behind the chimney, and crept to listen at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within was a lively conversation, and twice a shout of joy was heard and
      Marie, exultant, cried, &ldquo;Oh, Trude! dear Trude! all goes well, I fear
      nothing now. God has sent me the savior which I implored!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leberecht stood, bent over, applying his ear to the keyhole, listening to
      every word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, Trude! if you could only have seen the traitor, glued to the door,
      with open eyes and mouth! Could you have seen the eavesdropper rubbing his
      hands together, grinning, and listening in breathless suspense!
    </p>
    <p>
      Why cannot you surprise him, Trude, and fulfil your threat to deluge him
      and chase him away from your child&rsquo;s door? They forgot the necessity of
      prudence, and the possibility of being overheard. At last it occurred to
      the old servant, and she tore open the door, but no one was there&mdash;it
      was deserted and still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God be thanked, no one has listened,&rdquo; whispered Trude. &ldquo;I will go down
      and tell them that I hope, if we can stay alone all day, you will be
      calmer and more reasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it, Trude; I do not dare to see any one for fear my face will betray
      me, and my mother has very sharp eyes. Return soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door, and saw not the eavesdropper and spy, who had but
      just time to conceal himself, and stand maliciously grinning at the
      retreating figure of the faithful servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped lightly from his hiding-place down to his sleeping-room, in a
      niche under the stairs. For a long time he reflected, upon his bedside&mdash;his
      watery blue eyes staring at nothing. &ldquo;This must be well considered,&rdquo; he
      mumbled. &ldquo;There is, at last, a capital to be won. Which shall I do first,
      to grasp a good deal? Shall I wait, or go at once to Herr Ebenstreit? Very
      naturally they would both deny it, and say that I had made up the whole
      story to gain money. I had better let the affair go on: they can take a
      short drive, and when they are about an hour absent, I will sell my secret
      at a higher price. Now I will pretend to be quite harmless, and after
      supper let the bomb burst!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXV. THE ELOPEMENT.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Evening had set in. The card-table had been arranged, and Leberecht had
      rolled his master to it, taking his place behind his chair. The hour of
      whist the general impatiently awaited the entire day, and it was regularly
      observed. Even in the contract with his adopted son it had been expressly
      mentioned as a duty, that he should not only secure to them yearly income,
      but also devote an hour to cards every evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Ebenstreit regarded it as a tax, which he must observe until married.
      The general was much his superior at cards, and, moreover, played the
      dummy, and the stake being high, it was quite an income for the future
      father-in-law, and regarded by him as the one bright spot in his daily
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cards had been dealt, and Leberecht had assorted the general&rsquo;s, and
      placed them in his gouty hand, when Trude entered, exultingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has happened? What makes you interrupt us?&rdquo; cried the general. &ldquo;Did
      you not remember that I have told you always not to disturb us at this
      hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, general, but I thought good news was never amiss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you pleasant to tell us?&rdquo; harshly demanded Frau von Werrig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My young lady&rsquo;s compliments,&rdquo; cried Trude, triumphantly; &ldquo;she begins to
      see that she must yield to her fate, and that it will do no good to resist
      any longer. She will be ready for the ceremony at eleven o&rsquo;clock to-morrow
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general uttered a cry of joy, and struck the table so violently, with
      his hand, that the cards were thrown together.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife bowed dignifiedly, and the happy bridegroom gave old Trude some
      gold-pieces upon the favorable news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she, then, been converted by your persuasion?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Through my persuasion and her own good sense. She understands that, if
      she cannot marry her dear Moritz, Herr Ebenstreit is the most fit husband,
      because he loves her, and is so generous to her old parents. One thing she
      would like an answer to&mdash;can I accompany her to her new home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, old woman, it will be very agreeable to have so sensible a person,&rdquo;
       said Ebenstreit. &ldquo;Tell Marie that it gives me pleasure to fulfil her
      wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case I would repeat that Fraulein begs for indulgence and
      forbearance until to-morrow, and would like to remain alone to compose
      herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not wish, in the least, to see her,&rdquo; said her mother; &ldquo;she can do
      what she likes until then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell Marie, and she will rejoice,&rdquo; cried Trude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell her, from her father, that it is very agreeable to him not to see
      her pale, wretched-looking face again till morning.&mdash;Now, my son, pay
      attention, and you, Trude, do not presume to interrupt us again.
      Leberecht, play out my ace of hearts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter, with his eyes cast down, and with a perfectly indifferent
      manner, played the card indicated, and Trude left the room quietly and
      unobserved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every thing is arranged, my child,&rdquo; said Trude, as she re-entered Marie&rsquo;s
      room. &ldquo;They are playing cards, which always lasts two hours, then Herr
      Ebenstreit goes away, and the family will go to bed. You have eighteen
      hours, before you will be discovered. Hark! it strikes seven, and it is
      already quite dark. When the post-horn sounds, then it is time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Trude! my dear mother, my heart almost ceases to beat, with anxiety,
      and I quake with fear,&rdquo; sighed Marie. &ldquo;I am conscious that I have
      commenced a fearful undertaking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have driven you to it&mdash;it is not your fault,&rdquo; said Trude,
      consolingly. &ldquo;Every human being is free to work out his own good or bad
      fortune, and, as our dear Old Fritz says, &lsquo;to be happy in the future world
      in his own way.&rsquo; They have sold you for money, and you only prove to them
      that you are no slave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I prove also that I am a disobedient daughter,&rdquo; added Marie,
      trembling. &ldquo;At this hour, it weighs like a heavy burden upon my heart, and
      the words of Holy Writ burn into my very soul&mdash;&lsquo;Honor thy father and
      thy mother, that it may be well with thee.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have honored them all your life,&rdquo; said Trude, solemnly; &ldquo;I can
      witness it before God and man. You have worked for them without thanks or
      love, receiving only contempt. It is also written, &lsquo;Thou shalt leave
      father and mother, and cleave unto thy husband.&rsquo; You still follow the
      commands of God, and may it bring you happiness and blessing. My prayers
      and thoughts go with you, my child! a mother could not love her offspring
      more tenderly than I do you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No mother could more tenderly and faithfully care for her than you have
      for me, Trude,&rdquo; cried Marie, pressing her lovingly to her breast. &ldquo;Through
      you alone is my rescue possible, for you give us the money to undertake
      the long journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; she laughed; &ldquo;it is Herr Ebenstreit, and that makes it the more
      amusing; the wicked always set the traps into which they fall themselves.&rdquo;
       Suddenly the loud, quivering tones of the post-horn were heard, &ldquo;Es ritten
      drei Reiter zum Thore hinaus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has come!&rdquo; cried Marie, and her face beamed with delight. &ldquo;He calls
      me! I am coming!&mdash;Farewell, dear, peaceful room, where I have so
      toiled, wept, and suffered! I shall never see thee again! My beloved calls
      me, and I go to follow him even unto death! Pardon me, O God! Thou seest
      that I cannot do otherwise! They would force me to perjury, and I dare not
      break my oath! I cannot forsake him whom I love!&mdash;When they curse me,
      Trude, kneel, and implor God to bless me, who is the Father of love! My
      conscience does not reproach me. I have worked for them when they needed
      it; now their adopted son, to whom they have sold their name, allows them
      a yearly rent, and I can work for myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! there is the post-horn again, you must go,&rdquo; murmured Trude,
      struggling to force back her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, mother,&rdquo; implored Marie, kneeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rsquo;s blessing go with you,&rdquo; she said, laying her hands upon her head,
      &ldquo;and may it render of no avail the curses of men, but permit you to walk
      in love and happiness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen, amen!&rdquo; sighed Marie, &ldquo;now farewell, dear mother, farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie rose, and kissing Trude again, flitted down the stairs, and out of
      the house, Trude following, holding her breath and listening in fearful
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again resounded the post-horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are gone,&rdquo; murmured Trude, bowing her head and praying long and
      fervently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general was particularly fortunate this evening, which caused him to
      be unusually cheerful and satisfied. After every rubber he gathered up the
      thalers, until he had amassed a most satisfactory pile. As the clock
      struck ten, Frau von Werrig declared that they must finish and go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general yielded, with a sigh, to her decision, for he knew, by long
      years of experience, that it would be in vain to defy her will. He shoved
      his winnings into a leather bag, which he always carried with him, and
      gave Leberecht the order to roll away his chair, when the servant, with a
      solemn bow, stepped closely to him, and begged the general to listen to
      him a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what have you to say?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have only one request&mdash;that you will permit me to prove that I am
      a faithful servant, who looks out for the good of his employers. You have
      given Trude five hundred thalers that she might watch over your daughter.
      I can show you how well she deserved it, and how differently your humble
      servant would have done.&mdash;Have the goodness, Frau von Werrig, to call
      Trude to bid Fraulein come down, for you have something important to
      communicate to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mistress proudly regarded him and seemed to try to read his meaning in
      his smiling, humble face. &ldquo;And if my daughter comes, what have you to
      say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she comes, then I am a miserable fool and scoundrel, but I beg you to
      call Trude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a long time before the old woman appeared, confused and sleepy,
      asking&mdash;&ldquo;what they wanted at such a late hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go and tell my daughter that I wish to see her at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trude trembled, but composed herself, saying, &ldquo;There is time enough
      to-morrow. Fraulein has been asleep a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She lies,&rdquo; sneered Leberecht, taking the precaution to protect himself
      behind the general&rsquo;s arm-chair. &ldquo;She knows that she is not in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you sneak, you rascal,&rdquo; cried Trude, shaking her fist at him, &ldquo;how
      dare you say that I tell a lie? How can such a miserable creature as you
      impute to others what you do yourself every time that you open your
      mouth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frau von Werrig, she is only quarrelling, in order to gain time&mdash;every
      moment is precious. I beg you to go up-stairs, and see for yourself, if
      your daughter is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fraulein has locked the door so as not to be disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Leberecht, &ldquo;Trude has locked it, and has the key in her
      pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give up the key,&rdquo; shrieked the general, who in vain tried to rise, &ldquo;or I
      will call the police, and send you to prison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it, but I will not give it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see she has it?&rdquo; cried Leberecht.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you wretch, I will pay you&mdash;I will scratch your eyes out, you
      miserable creature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trude, be quiet,&rdquo; commanded Ebenstreit; &ldquo;the general orders to give up
      the key&mdash;do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do it at once,&rdquo; shrieked Frau von Werrig, &ldquo;or I will dismiss you
      from my service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That you will not have to do, as I shall go myself. I will not give up
      the key.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The door is old, and with a good push one could open it,&rdquo; said Leberecht.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, my son, let us see,&rdquo; said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hastened up to the room, while the general scolded, furiously that he
      must sit still. Leberecht and Trude cast furious, menacing glances at each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a loud crash was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have broken open the door!&rdquo; cried the general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said that it was old and frail&mdash;what do you say now, beautiful
      Trude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman wiped with her hand the drops of perspiration from her
      forehead, caused by her anguish. &ldquo;You are a bad fellow, and God will
      punish you for your treason, that you have tormented a noble, unhappy
      girl. I saw that you were an eavesdropper, and you know all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is gone!&rdquo; shrieked the mother, rushing into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The room is empty,&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit. &ldquo;Marie is not there. Tell us,
      Leberecht, what you know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, if we can agree about the pay&mdash;the old woman bothers me, and
      beg the young gentleman to go into the next room with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Almighty God, have compassion upon my poor little Marie,&rdquo; murmured
      Trude, kneeling, and covering her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit in the mean time withdrew to the other room, followed by the
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; commanded his master, &ldquo;and tell me what you have to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leberecht shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;We are two men who have urgent business
      with each other. I am not at present a servant and you the master. I am a
      man who has an important secret to sell, and you are the man who would buy
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What strange, unheard-of language is this?&rdquo; said Ebenstreit, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The language of a man who cannot only deprive the rich banker Ebenstreit
      of a lovely wife, but of his title also. You said yourself, sir, this
      morning, that it was only valid if you succeeded in marrying the daughter
      of General von Leuthen. No none knows where you can find your bride but
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Trude,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know she will not betray Fraulein, and you have not even tried to
      make her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken; Trude is as easily bought as any one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that because she has taken five hundred thalers from you. She has
      not helped you, and it is useless to ask for your money, as she has not
      got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so? Has she given it away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You provided the money for your bride to run away and marry elsewhere, as
      Trude gave it to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit stamped his foot with rage, striding backward and forward in
      furious excitement, while Leberecht watched him, sardonically smiling.
      &ldquo;Let us come to an end with this business,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit, stopping
      before his servant. &ldquo;You know where Fraulein can be found, and you wish to
      sell the secret&mdash;tell me your price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three thousand thalers, and a clerkship in your bank, which you intend to
      continue under another name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are beside yourself. I am not so foolish as to grant such senseless
      demands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every hour that you wait I demand a thousand thalers more, and if you
      stop to reflect long your betrothed and your title both are lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a miserable scamp!&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit, enraged; &ldquo;I will inform the
      police. There are means enough to force you to give the information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not believe it. Trude will not tell you, and I should like to know
      what can force me if I will not. The king has done away with torture, and
      I have informed you how to make me speak. Three thousand thalers and a
      clerkship in your office. Take care! it is almost eleven o&rsquo;clock&mdash;at
      midnight I shall demand four thousand.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI. UNDER THE STARRY HEAVENS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful, clear, moonlight night. The world reposed in silence.
      Mankind with their cares and sorrows, their joys and hopes, had gone to
      rest. Over town and village, over highway and forest had flitted the
      sweet, consoling angel&mdash;Sleep. The sad were soothed, the heavy-laden
      were lightened of their burdens, to the despairing were brought golden
      dreams, to the weary rest. Sighing and sorrowful, he turned from those
      with a sad face whose conscience banished repose, and, ah! their number
      was legion. To the wakeful and blissful he smilingly glanced, breathing a
      prayer and a blessing; but these were few and far between&mdash;for
      happiness is a rare guest, and tarries with mortals but fitfully. As he
      glided past the joyful couple who, with watchful love and grateful hearts,
      sat in the carriage rolling over the silent, deserted highway, two tears
      fell from his eyes, and his starry wings were wider outspread to rush more
      quickly past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, my dear Marie, two stars just fell from heaven. They are a greeting
      to you, loved one, and they would say they guide us on our way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Philip, it is a sign of ill-luck! Falling stars betoken misfortune!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She clung closer to his side, and laid her head upon his shoulder. He
      pressed her more lovingly to his heart. &ldquo;Do not fear, dear Marie;
      separation only could cause us unhappiness&mdash;we have long borne it,
      and now it is forever past. You have given yourself to me for my own, and
      I am yours, heart and soul; we speed on through the night to the morning
      of the bright, sunny future, never more to be parted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never!&rdquo; she fervently murmured. &ldquo;Oh, may God hear our prayer. Never,
      never to part! Yet, while the word falls from my lips, a shudder creeps
      through my soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wherefore this despair, dearest? Reflect, no one will be apprised of our
      flight till early morning, and then they will not know whither we have
      fled. Meanwhile we rush on to Hamburg, where a packet-ship sails every
      Wednesday for England; arriving there, we will first go to Suffolk, to my
      old friend the vicar of Tunningham. I was his guest many weeks last year,
      and he often related to me the privilege which had been conferred on the
      parish church for a long time to perform valid marriages for those to
      whose union there were obstacles interposed elsewhere. He will bless the
      union of our love, and will accord me the lawful right to call you my own
      before God and man. We will not return at once to Germany. I have many
      connections and literary friends in London, who will assist me to worthy
      occupation. Besides, I closed an agreement some weeks since with the
      publisher Nicolai in Berlin for a new work. I will write it in London; it
      will be none the less favored coming from a distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My flowers and paintings will also be as well received in as in Berlin,&rdquo;
       added Marie, smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Marie, you shall not work. I shall have the precious care of
      providing for you, which will be my pride and happiness. Oh, my beloved,
      what a crowning bliss to possess a sweet, dear wife, who is only rich in
      imperishable treasures, and poor in external riches! What delight to toil
      for her, and feel that there lives in my intellect the power to grant her
      every wish, and to compensate her in the slightest degree the boundless
      wealth of her affection! To a loving mind there is no prouder, happier
      feeling than to be the only source of support to the wife of his love&mdash;to
      know that she looks to him for the fulfilment of her slightest wish in
      life. I thank my Maker that you are poor, Marie, and that I am permitted
      to toil for you. How else could I reward you for all you have sacrificed
      for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot suppose, dear Philip, that the riches of my obtrusive lover
      would have been any attraction to me. Money could never compensate for the
      loss of your love. You are my life, and from you alone can I receive
      happiness or unhappiness. At your side I am rich and joyous, though we may
      outwardly need; without you I should be poor with superfluity. I am proud
      that we in spirit have freed ourselves from those fictitious externals
      with which the foolish burden themselves. Oh, my beloved Philip, my whole
      soul is exultant that we are never more to part&mdash;no, not even in
      eternity, for I believe that love is an undying sentiment, and the soul
      can never be darkened by death which is beaming with affection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Marie, love is the immortality of the soul; through it man
      is regenerated and soars to the regions of eternal light. When I recall
      how desolate and gloomy was my life, how joyless the days dragged on
      before I loved you, I almost menaced Heaven that it created me to wander
      alone through this desert. The brightest sun&rsquo;s rays now gild my future,
      and it seems as if we were alone in paradise, and that the creation entire
      glorified my happiness, and all the voices of Nature shouted a greeting to
      you, dearest. Oh, Marie, if I lived a thousand years, my heart would
      retain its youthful love and adoration for you, who have saved me from
      myself, have freed my soul from the constraining fetters of a sad, joyless
      existence. Repose your head upon my heart, and may it rest there many
      happy years, and receive in this hour my oath to love, esteem, and honor
      you as my most precious treasure! You shall be wife, child, sister, and
      friend. My soul shall be frank and open to you; for you I will strive and
      toil, and will cherish and foster the happiness received from you as my
      most treasured gift. Give me your hand, Marie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laid it within his own strong, manly hand, gently pressing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large full moon, high above them, lighted up these noble faces, making
      the eyes, which were bent upon each other, more radiant. Swiftly the
      carriage rolled on, the night-breeze fanning their cheeks and waving back
      their raven curls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moritz raised their clasped hands, and gazed at the starry heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We lift them up unto Thee, O God. Thou hast heard my oath, O Eternal
      Spirit, who dwellest among the stars; receive it, and bless the woman I
      love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Receive also my oath, O my Maker. Regard the man to whom I have sworn
      eternal fidelity, bless him, and bless me. Let us live in love and die in
      constancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moritz responded, &ldquo;Amen, my beloved, amen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They embraced each other fervently. Onward rolled the carriage through the
      tranquil, blissful night. Oh why cannot these steeds borrow wings from the
      night-wind? Why cannot the soaring spirit bear aloft its earthly tenement?
      With divine joy and heavenly confidence you gaze at the stars. You
      smilingly interchange thoughts of the blissful future, whilst dire
      misfortune approaches, and will soon seize you in its poisonous grasp! Do
      you not hear it? Does not the echo of swift-prancing steeds ring in your
      ears? Do you not hear the shrieking and calling after you?
    </p>
    <p>
      They listen only to the voice of tenderness speaking in their hearts, and
      would that the solemn quiet of this dialogue might not be broken by a loud
      word from their lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The post-horn sounded! They halted at a lonely house near the highway. It
      is the station. Change horses! There is not a light to be seen. Three
      times the postilion blew a pealing blast ere they could awake the inmates.
      The window was at last opened, and a sleepy, complaining voice questioned
      the number of horses and the distance of the next post.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly they were brought forward, and still more slowly were they attached
      to the carriage, and all arranged. What matters it? The night is lovely,
      and like a dream it seems to remain under the starry heavens, spread out
      like a canopy above them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does not your heart tell you that sorrow strides on like the storm? Do you
      not hear the voices still shrieking after you?
    </p>
    <p>
      The postilion mounted his horse, and again the trumpet pealed forth its
      merry air, and was answered with a shout of triumph from the swift
      pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie raised her head from Philip&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;What was it? Did you not
      hear it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, my beloved, what should I hear? Do the stars salute you? Do the
      angels greet their sister upon earth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark! there it is again! Do you not hear it? Listen! does it not seem as
      if one called &lsquo;Halt! halt!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, truly, I hear it now also! What can happen, love? Why trouble
      ourselves about the outer world and the existence of other beings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not, but I am so anxious, my heart almost ceases to beat, with
      terror!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt! halt!&rdquo; the wind carries forward the shriek, and above their heads
      it sounds like the screeching of ravens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange! For whom are they calling?&rdquo; Moritz looked back along the
      highway. White and clear it lay in the moonlight, but, far in the distance
      was a black mass, taking form and shape at every moment!
    </p>
    <p>
      Horsemen! horsemen! in full speed they come!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Postilion! drive on! quick! Let the horses gallop! There is a forest near&mdash;drive
      us to that, that we may hide ourselves in the thicket! Onward, postilion!
      we are not thieves or murderers. A hundred thalers are yours, if you save
      us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postilion beat his horses! In full chase they followed&mdash;more and
      more distinctly were heard the curses and yells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God in heaven, have mercy upon us in our need!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faster, postilion!&mdash;in mercy, faster!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt! halt!&mdash;in the name of the king, halt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This startled the postilion, and he turned to listen, and again a furious
      voice yelled, &ldquo;In the name of the king, halt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postilion drew up. &ldquo;Forgive me, sir, but I must respect the name of
      the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forward galloped the horsemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip,&rdquo; whispered Marie, &ldquo;why do we live&mdash;why do we not die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He folded her in his arms, and passionately kissed her, perhaps for the
      last time. &ldquo;Marie, be mindful of our oath&mdash;constant unto death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Constant unto death!&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be firm and defy all the storms of life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie repeated it, with heightened courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horsemen surrounded the carriage, the riders upon panting steeds! Two
      officers in uniform sprang to the side, laying their hands upon Moritz&rsquo;s
      shoulder. &ldquo;Conrector Philip Moritz, we arrest you in the name of the king!
      You are accused of eloping with a minor, and we are commanded to transport
      you to Spandau until further orders!&rdquo; Upon the other side two other
      horsemen halted. The foremost was Herr Ebenstreit, who laid his hand upon
      Marie, and saw not or cared not that she shudderingly shrank away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Marie, I come as the ambassador of your parents, and am fully
      empowered to lead your back to your father&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She answered not, but sat immovable and benumbed with terror, the tears
      rolling down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You arrest me in the name of the king,&rdquo; cried Moritz; &ldquo;I bow to the law.
      I beg only to speak to that man,&rdquo; pointing to Ebenstreit, with contempt.
      &ldquo;Sir, dismount, I have important business with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have nothing to say to each other,&rdquo; answered Ebenstreit, calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I!&rdquo; cried Moritz, springing forward, furious as a lion, &ldquo;I have
      something to say to you, you rascal, and I will treat you accordingly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He savagely tore the whip from the postilion&rsquo;s hand, and struck Ebenstreit
      in the face. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried he, triumphantly, &ldquo;I have forced you to give me
      satisfaction!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The police swung themselves from their saddles, and Leberecht quickly
      dismounted. They clinched Moritz by the feet and hands. It was a desperate
      struggle, and Marie gazed at them with folded hands, praying without
      words. They seized him and held him fast with manacles. A shriek, and
      Marie sank fainting. Moritz&rsquo;s head sank upon his breast, almost in the
      agony of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take him to the next station, my friends,&rdquo; commanded Ebenstreit, &ldquo;the
      carriage is already ordered to remove him to Spandau.&rdquo; He dismounted, and
      now took the place by Marie, who still lay in a dead faint. &ldquo;Postilion,
      mount and turn your carriage, I retain you until the next station. If you
      drive quickly, there is a louis d&rsquo;or for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will drive as if the devil were after me, sir!&rdquo; shouted the postilion,
      and turned to gallop off, when Ebenstreit ordered him to halt, and
      Leberecht to get up on the box. Then turning to the officers, &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;
       said he, proudly, &ldquo;you are witnesses to the ill-treatment and insults of
      this woman-stealer. You will certify that the blood flowed down my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will myself make it known before all men,&rdquo; cried Moritz, with a
      contemptuous laugh. &ldquo;I have insulted you and branded you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will give our evidence,&rdquo; respectfully replied the officers. &ldquo;As soon
      as we have delivered our prisoner at Spandau, we will announce ourselves
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will receive from me the promised reward of a hundred thalers.
      If you hush up the entire adventure, so that it is not noised about, after
      three months, still another hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will be silent, Herr Ebenstreit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you; a hundred thalers is a pretty sum. Forward, Leberecht,
      make the postilion push on, that we may arrive in Berlin before daybreak,
      and no one know of this abominable affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The postilion laughed with delight, at the thought of the louis d&rsquo;or. Upon
      the box sat Leberecht, a smile of malicious triumph upon his face. &ldquo;This
      has been a lucky night,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;we have all done a good business, but I
      am the most fortunate, with my three thousand thalers and a fine place. I
      wish he had waited an hour later, and then I should have had another
      thousand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit sat with triumphant smile also, by his betrothed. &ldquo;Money is the
      king of the world&mdash;with it one can accomplish all things,&rdquo; said he to
      himself; &ldquo;if I had been a poor fellow, the general would not have chosen
      me, nor the king have given me a title, nor could I have won back my
      beautiful bride. Money gives position, and I hope will give me the power
      to revenge myself for the pain in my face.&rdquo; He turned menacingly toward
      Moritz, who saw it not.
    </p>
    <p>
      With bowed head, speechless, as if numb with the horror of his misfortune,
      he rode with fettered hands between the two officers, incapable of
      fleeing, as they had even bound a cord around his arms, each end held fast
      by one of the riders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars and the moon shone down upon him as brightly beautiful as an
      hour previous. Oh, Marie, you were right, falling stars betoken
      misfortune! Your star has fallen!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVII. THE SACRIFICE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since that painful night, four weeks had passed, four long ones to poor
      old Trude. To her beloved child they had fled in happy unconsciousness. In
      the delirium of fever, her thoughts wandered to her lover, always dwelling
      upon her hopes and happiness. In the intervals of reason she asked for him
      with fearful excitement and anxiety, then again her mind was clouded, and
      the cry of anguish was changed into a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the days of convalescence and the return to consciousness, and
      with it the mourning over crushed hopes. Slowly had Trude, the faithful
      nurse, who watched by her bedside day and night, answered her excited
      questions, and to her little by little the circumstances of the elopement&mdash;how
      Leberecht had played the eavesdropper and sold Marie&rsquo;s secret for gold;
      how he had previously arranged to pursue them, informing the police,
      ordering the horses, and sending forward a courier to provide fresh relays
      at every station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trude depicted the anger of her father and the threats of her mother to
      send her to prison. But before she could execute her purpose, Ebenstreit
      had brought home the unconscious child, and she herself had lifted her
      from the carriage and borne her, with the aid of her mistress, to her own
      little attic room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie listened to these relations with a gloomy calmness and a defiant
      sorrow. Illness had wrought a peculiar change in her mind, and hardened
      the gentle, tender feelings of the young girl. Grief had steeled her soul,
      benumbed her heart, and she had risen from her couch as one born anew to
      grief and torture. Her present situation and lost happiness had changed
      the young, loving, tenderly-sensitive maiden to the courageous, energetic,
      and defiant woman, who recognized a future of self-renunciation, combat,
      and resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trude observed these changes with disquietude and care. She wished Marie
      would only once complain, or burst into tears. After the first storm of
      despair had passed, the tears refused to flow, and her eyes were bright
      and undimmed. Only once had profound emotion been awakened, as Trude asked
      her if she had forgotten her unhappy lover, and cared no more to learn his
      fate. It had the desired effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deathly paleness overspread her delicate, transparent cheek. &ldquo;I know how
      he is,&rdquo; she said, turning away her face, &ldquo;I realize his sufferings by my
      own. We are miserable, lost&mdash;and no hope but in death. Ere this
      comes, there is a desert to traverse in heat, and dust, and storm, and
      frost, alone, without consolation or support. Hush, Trude! do not seek to
      revive miserable hopes. I know my fate, and I will endure it. Tell me what
      you know about him? Where is he? Have they accused him? Speak! do not fear
      to tell me every thing!&rdquo; But fearing herself, she threw her handkerchief
      quickly over her face, and sat with it covered whilst Trude spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know but little of poor, dear Moritz. He has never returned to his
      lodgings. A day or two after that night, two officers sealed his effects,
      and took away his clothes. His hostess has not the least suspicion of the
      mysterious disappearance of her otherwise quiet, regular lodger. The
      secret of the elopement has been carefully guarded, as no one of the
      neighbors know it, and there is no gossip about you and Moritz. Those who
      think he is travelling are not surprised at his having left without taking
      leave, as they say he was accustomed to do so. But,&rdquo; continued Trude, in a
      lower tone, &ldquo;Herr Gedicke looked very sad and grave, as I asked for the
      Conrector Moritz. &lsquo;He has disappeared,&rsquo; he sighed, &lsquo;and I know not if we
      shall ever see him again.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, Jemima!&rsquo; I screamed, &lsquo;you do not think
      that he has committed a self-injury!&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the director, &lsquo;not he
      himself, he is too honorable a man. Others have ill-treated him and made
      him unhappy for life.&rsquo; It was in vain to ask further; he knew not or he
      would not say any thing. I believe your family know where poor Moritz is,
      for your mother speaks of him as one in the penitentiary, and quite
      triumphantly she told me yesterday that the king, in his new book of laws,
      had expressly condemned the person who elopes with a minor to be sent to
      the house of correction for ten years, and then she laughed so cruelly,
      that I trembled to hear her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Trude related this, she searchingly glanced at Marie to observe the
      effect of her words, hoping to see her weep or complain and that, at last,
      grief would melt the icy crust around her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Marie sat motionless and without uttering a sound&mdash;not a sigh or
      a moan escaped her. After a long silence, when her grief was too deep for
      tears, she drew the handkerchief from her face, the pallor and rigidity of
      which startled Trude.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sprang forward, folding her in her arms. &ldquo;Marie, child of my heart, do
      weep, do complain! I know that he loved you dearly, and deserves that you
      should mourn for him. Have you no more confidence, though, in your old
      Trude? Is she no longer worthy to share your grief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie laid her languid head upon the bosom of her faithful nurse; a
      long-drawn, piercing cry of anguish was her response, she trembled
      violently, and the tears ran down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trude raised her eyes to heaven, murmuring, &ldquo;I thank thee, O Lord! Her
      heart is not dead! It lives, for it suffers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It suffers,&rdquo; groaned Marie, &ldquo;the anguish of death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This passionate outburst of feeling was of but short duration. Her tears
      were dried, and her quivering face assumed its usually calm expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trude,&rdquo; said she, gently, continuing to repose upon her bosom, &ldquo;I am so
      wretched that words cannot express it or tears soothe it. If I should give
      myself up to sorrow and mourning I should die, and that cannot be, for I
      must live to wait for him&mdash;to rescue him. How I know not yet; my
      thoughts and resolutions are so confused that they flicker like the ignes
      fatui. I will force my mind to be calm, and these wandering lights shall
      unite in one glowing flame to destroy the walls and obstructions which
      confine him. He is a prisoner; I feel it in my heart, and I must live to
      free him. This is my task, and I will accomplish it; therefore I would be
      composed, and strong in myself. Wonder not that I weep or complain no
      more, and do not refer to my misfortune. I should die if I did not
      suppress this anguish, and I would become strong and active. Seek not to
      enfeeble me, but aid me to harden myself; refrain from complaint, that I
      may be silent. I think only of him, and I ask nothing further than to
      yield my life to free him. Let us never speak of it again, for I feel that
      all the firmness which I had gained has been swept from me in this giving
      way, and that I must begin anew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From this hour she commenced to build, and rose upon her grief as on a
      column which projects toward heaven; leaned upon it, and received, as
      Brisaeus from the earth, the power of life and action. She had already so
      conquered herself as to be able to leave her own quiet room, and descend
      to that of her parents. There she would sit calmly for hours, listening
      attentively to the conversation, hoping to catch some word that might give
      her a clew.
    </p>
    <p>
      They avoided every exciting topic, and were milder and more thoughtful for
      her. Even her mother made no reproaches, and never alluded to the past,
      because she feared to delay her recovery, and remove the longed-for goal
      in hindering the marriage with Ebenstreit. The latter carefully avoided
      troubling her by his presence; when he heard Marie&rsquo;s step in the anteroom,
      who descended at a certain hour every day, he withdrew by the other
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who goes out every time I come in?&rdquo; asked Marie, one day as she appeared
      in the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general coughed with embarrassment, and glanced anxiously at his wife,
      whose eyes rested upon her daughter with a cold, searching expression.
      Their eyes met, and were riveted upon each other. A cold, cruel smile
      played around the thin, bloodless lips of the mother as she recognized the
      defiance and firmness in her child, and felt that she had recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is your betrothed,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;our dear Ebenstreit&mdash;a good,
      generous, and self-sacrificing son, for whom we thank God every day, who
      wishes to spare you the annoyance of seeing him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He need not inconvenience himself on my account. Nothing excites or
      wounds my feelings now. It would be a pity for your heartless, thankless
      daughter to deprive you of the society of your dear son. Let him remain;
      it is not necessary for us to notice one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her parents regarded each other astonished, and, as she ceased, they still
      listened to the dying tones of her voice, which sounded so strangely to
      them. &ldquo;She is much changed,&rdquo; mumbled the general to himself. &ldquo;She does not
      seem the same person, she is so haughty and majestic. She might well
      inspire fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following day, as Marie entered the room, Ebenstreit was there. He
      approached her, extending both hands smiling, and greeting her with tender
      words, rejoicing at her recovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took no notice of his friendly demonstrations, but coldly and harshly
      regarded his smiling face, and particularly the broad, blood-red scar
      which ran from forehead to chin. Then suddenly her face lighted up, and an
      expression of savage triumph shot from her eyes. &ldquo;How disfigured you
      look,&rdquo; she cried exultingly. &ldquo;Where did you get that scar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know well, Marie,&rdquo; he murmured, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she cried, triumphantly. &ldquo;I know it. He branded you, and you will
      wear this mark before God and man as long as you live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very cruel to remind me of it, Marie,&rdquo; he softly whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed aloud so wild and savagely, that even her mother was startled.
      &ldquo;Cruel&mdash;I cruel!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Ah, sir, it becomes you indeed to
      accuse me of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trude entered at this instant, pale and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is some one here who wishes to speak with you, Marie; he has
      something very important to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How dare you announce any one without my permission?&rdquo; cried Frau von
      Werrig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, mother!&mdash;if I may be allowed, let us hear who it is.&mdash;Speak,
      dear Trude, who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the Director Gedicke from the Gray Cloister,&rdquo; said Trude, with
      quivering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie was startled&mdash;a glowing red overspread her cheeks, and she was
      obliged to lean against a chair for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forbid you to receive him,&rdquo; said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly ceased, and stared at the door, which opened at that moment,
      the tall, dignified form of a venerable old man appearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, sir,&rdquo; said he, with a cold, reserved manner, &ldquo;if I enter
      before I receive permission. The command of the king, to which I believe
      we all yield without resistance, empowers me to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, sir, you come by the king&rsquo;s order?&rdquo; asked the general, who rose with
      difficulty. &ldquo;Has his majesty given you a message for General von Leuthen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, general, I come with a communication from his majesty to Fraulein von
      Leuthen, the betrothed of Herr Ebenstreit, and the order runs to deliver
      the same personally and without witnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; cried the mother, shrugging her shoulders, &ldquo;you mistake us
      for very innocent people, if you suppose we believe this silly invention,
      and that you can gain a secret conversation by a ruse with our daughter.
      You are the director of the gymnasium, and naturally the friend of
      Conrector Moritz. In his name you will speak, and bring a secret message.
      Very sly, indeed, very sly, but it will not succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For response, the director drew two large folded documents from his
      pocket, approaching the general. &ldquo;Do you recognize this seal?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; solemnly answered the general; &ldquo;it is the royal seal from the
      king&rsquo;s private cabinet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read the address upon this, and the unopened letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly, the latter is directed to my daughter, and the other to Professor
      Gedicke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr Gedicke opened the letter, asking the general if he could recognize
      the king&rsquo;s handwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I know it well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the goodness to read the lines upon the margin,&rdquo; mid the professor,
      unfolding the letter, so that he could only read those referred to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general read: &ldquo;Professor Gedicke shall go himself to Fraulein von
      Leuthen, and bring her to reason, reading the document to her without
      witnesses. I wish this affair to come to an end. Teach Mamselle mores!
      mores! mores! FREDERICK.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard the royal command, ladies and gentlemen; will you respect
      it?&rdquo; said the professor, turning around with an air of proud satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear son-in-law,&rdquo; said the general, solemnly, &ldquo;it is a royal command;
      give me your arm, as you know I am feeble; and you, my wife, take my other
      arm, and we will go into the next room. Hush! not a word&mdash;we have
      only to obey, and not reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He seized his wife&rsquo;s hand hastily and firmly, that she should not slip
      away, and winked to Ebenstreit, upon whose support he crossed the room,
      drawing his wife with him, and pushing open the door of the next with his
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie had stood during the whole transaction pale and rigid in the centre
      of the room, looking haughty and defiant as long as her parents and Herr
      Ebenstreit were present. Now, as the door closed, life and action were
      visible in this marble form; she rushed to the old gentleman, scarce
      respiring, and looking up at his dignified, sad face, asked: &ldquo;Is he
      living? Tell me only this, or is he ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he lives, he does not suffer from bodily ills, but the sickness of
      the soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do not I also?&rdquo; asked she, with quivering voice. &ldquo;Oh! I know what he
      suffers, as we are wretched from the same cause. But tell me, have you
      seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Fraulein, I have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is he? Where did you see him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In prison!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie grew paler, and retreated, shuddering. The director continued: &ldquo;In a
      dark, damp prison at Spandau. The poor fellow has been there for two
      months without air, light, or occupation, and his only society is his own
      revengeful thoughts and angry love-complaints.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie gave one hollow moan, covering her corpse-like face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this abode of torture, in this dwelling of the damned, he must remain
      ten long years, if death does not release him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; she groaned. &ldquo;Ten long years? Have they condemned
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was guilty of a great crime&mdash;eloping with a minor&mdash;who,
      with the king&rsquo;s consent, and that of her parents, was betrothed to
      another. Read the sentence of the court, which was forwarded to me as the
      head of the college where Moritz was employed. See, here is the king&rsquo;s
      signature, which affirms the sentence, rendering it legal, and here upon
      the margin are the lines your father read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trembling, Marie perused the contents. &ldquo;Ten years in the house of
      correction!&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;On my account condemned to a living death! No,
      no, it is impossible! It cannot be! Ten years of the best part of life! He
      condemned as a criminal! I will go to the king. I will throw myself at his
      feet, imploring for mercy. I am the guilty one&mdash;I alone! They should
      judge me, and send me to the penitentiary! I will go to the king! He must
      and will hear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will not,&rdquo; sighed the director. &ldquo;Listen to me, poor child! As I heard
      the sentence, I felt it my duty to summon all my powers to rescue Moritz,
      for I love him as a son, and had set my hopes upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you for this kind word,&rdquo; said Marie, seizing the hand of the old
      man, and pressing it to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went immediately to Minister von Herzberg, and, upon his advice, as he
      explained to me the king might lighten his punishment, I betook myself to
      Frederick&rsquo;s winter-quarters at Breslau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You noble, generous man, I shall love you for it as long as I live. Did
      you speak with the king?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and every thing that my heart or mind could inspire, to excuse and
      justify my unhappy friend, I have said&mdash;but all in vain. The king was
      much embittered, because he had had the grace to grant him an audience,
      and explain the impossibility of the fulfilment of his petition. I did not
      cease begging and imploring, until I softened the generous heart of the
      king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he pardoned Moritz?&rdquo; Marie asked, with brightening hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under certain conditions he will allow that he should escape secretly
      from prison. They are formally written, and if Moritz consents and binds
      himself by oath, he will not only be freed, but provided with means to go
      to England, and receive immediately an appointment as translator to the
      Prussian embassy at London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are the conditions, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are, first, that Moritz shall by oath renounce every wish and
      thought of uniting himself with Fraulein von Leuthen; secondly, that
      before he leaves the prison, he shall write to the young lady, in which he
      shall solemnly release her, and enjoin it upon her as a duty to accept the
      hand of the man to whom her parents have betrothed her. These were the
      conditions, and the king commanded me to go to Spandau, and with sensible
      representations, to confer with Moritz, and persuade him to accept them,
      and assure himself of freedom, and an honorable future, free from care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw Moritz?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you communicate the conditions?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He refused, with rage and indignation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He refused?&rdquo; cried Marie, joyfully. &ldquo;Oh, my dear Philip, I thank you. You
      love me truly and faithfully. Your glorious example shall inspire me to be
      as firm as you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy child, you know not what you are saying!&rdquo; cried the director,
      sadly. &ldquo;If you really love him, you could not follow his example. Read
      what the king has written.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took, in breathless silence, the document, and broke the seal,
      unfolding the paper, but her hand shook it so violently, that she could
      not distinguish the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned it to the director. &ldquo;Read it, I cannot,&rdquo; she said, and sank
      kneeling, looking up to the old man with unspeakable anguish, and
      listening to every word that fell from his lips. It ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His majesty announces to Mademoiselle Marie von Leuthen that he is
      exceedingly indignant at her improper and undutiful conduct, which does
      not at all become a maiden loving of honor, and particularly a noble one.
      His majesty ennobled her father for a brave deed, and he is angry that the
      daughter should bring shame upon the title, in giving way, not only to a
      passion which is beneath her, but is so little mindful of morality as to
      flee from the paternal house, at night, in an improper manner, with a man
      whose wife, according to the command of the king and the will of her
      father, she could never be. If his majesty did not respect the former
      service of her father, and the new title, he would send the daughter to
      the house of correction, and punish her according to the law. But he will
      leave her to the reproaches of conscience, and let the weight of the law
      fall upon her partner in guilt, Philip Moritz. He is rightly sentenced to
      ten years in the house of correction, and he will not be released one year
      or one day from the same, as he is guilty of a great crime, and his
      sentence is just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just!&rdquo; shrieked Marie, in anguish&mdash;&ldquo;ten years just?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The director continued to read: &ldquo;His majesty will propose a last
      opportunity to the obstinate and inconsiderate young lady to reinstate her
      own honor, and release at the same time Conrector Moritz. His majesty has
      personal knowledge of the latter, and respects his scholarly attainments
      and capability and would bring an end to this affair for the general good.
      If mademoiselle, as becomes an honorable young woman, and an obedient
      daughter, follows the wishes of her father, and without delay marries Herr
      Ebenstreit, and leads a respectable life with him, the same hour of the
      ceremony Conrector Moritz shall be released, and a fit position be created
      for him. This is the final decision of the king. If the daughter does not
      submit in perfect obedience, she will burden her conscience with a great
      crime, and thank herself for Moritz&rsquo;s unfortunate fate. His majesty will
      be immediately informed of her decision. If she listens to reason, to
      morality, and affection, she will submit to the proposition which Director
      Gedicke is commissioned to make known to her, and announce to her parents
      in his presence that she will obediently follow their commands, Conrector
      Moritz will be at once set at liberty; otherwise he will be sent to
      Brandenburg to the house of correction. This is the unalterable will of
      the king. Signed, in the name of the king, FREDERICK.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now decide, my child,&rdquo; continued the director, after a solemn pause. &ldquo;I
      know nothing to add to this royal writing. If it has not itself spoken to
      your heart, your reason and your honor, words are useless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God, it is cruel&mdash;it is terrible!&rdquo; cried Marie. &ldquo;Shall I break my
      oath of constancy, becoming faithless, and suffer him to curse me, for he
      will never pardon me, but despise me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sprang up like a tigress, with her eyes flashing. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;he
      may even believe that I have been enticed by riches, by a brilliant
      future! No&mdash;no! I cannot consent! May God have mercy on me if the
      king will not! I will not break my oath! No one but Moritz shall ever be
      my husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy girl,&rdquo; cried the old man, sadly, &ldquo;I will give you one last
      inducement. I know not whether you have any knowledge of Moritz&rsquo;s past
      life, so tried and painful, which has made him easily excited and
      eccentric. A danger menaces him worse than imprisonment or death. His
      unaccustomed life, and the solitude of his dark, damp prison, is causing a
      fearful excitement in him. He is habituated to intellectual occupation.
      When he is obliged to put on the prisoner&rsquo;s jacket in the house of
      correction and spin wool, it will not kill him&mdash;it will make him
      mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A piercing cry was Marie&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;That is not true&mdash;it is
      impossible. He crazy!&mdash;you only say that to compel me to do what you
      will. His bright mind could not be obscured through the severest proofs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not believe me? You think that an old man, with gray hair, and one
      foot in the grave, and who loves Moritz, could tell you a shameful
      untruth! I swear to you by the heads of my children, by all that is holy,
      that Moritz already suffers from an excitement of the brain; and if he
      does not soon have liberty and mental occupation, it is almost certain
      that he will become insane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Almost convulsed with anguish, Marie seized the old man&rsquo;s hand with fierce
      passion. &ldquo;He shall not be crazed,&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;He shall not suffer&mdash;he
      shall not be imprisoned and buried in the house of correction on my
      account. I will rescue him&mdash;I and my love! I am prepared to do what
      the king commands! I will&mdash;marry the man&mdash;which&mdash;my parents
      have chosen. But&mdash;tell me, will he then be free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day even&mdash;in three hours, my poor child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free! And I shall have saved him! Tell me what I have to do. What is the
      king&rsquo;s will?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First sign this document,&rdquo; said the director, as he drew a second paper.
      &ldquo;It runs thus: &lsquo;I, Marie von Leuthen, that of my own free will and consent
      I will renounce every other engagement, and will marry Herr Ebenstreit von
      Leuthen, and be a faithful wife to him. I witness with my signature the
      same.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to me quickly,&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;I will sign it! He must be free! He
      shall not go mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rapidly signed the paper. &ldquo;Here is my sentence of death! But he will
      live! Take it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; cried the old man, deeply agitated, &ldquo;God will be mindful of
      this sacrifice, and in the hour of death it will beam brightly upon you.
      You have by this act rescued a noble and excellent being, and when he wins
      fame from science and art he will owe to you alone the gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall not thank me!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;He shall live and&mdash;if he can
      be happy!&mdash;this is all that I ask for! What is there further to be
      done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To announce to your parents in my presence that you will marry Herr
      Ebenstreit, and let the ceremony take place as soon as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You swear that he shall then be released? You are an old man&mdash;reflect
      well; you swear to me that as soon as the marriage takes place, Philip
      Moritz will be free this very day and that he will be reinstated in an
      honorable, active occupation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear it to you upon my word of honor, by my hope of reward from
      above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you. Call my parents. But first&mdash;you are a father, and
      love your children well. I have never had a father who loved me, or ever
      laid his hand upon my head to bless me. You say that you love Moritz as a
      son! Oh, love me for a moment as your daughter, and bless me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man folded her in his arms, tears streaming down his cheeks. &ldquo;God
      bless you, my daughter, as I bless you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not tarry,&rdquo; she shuddered. &ldquo;Let my parents enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly the venerable man traversed the room. Marie pressed her hands to
      her heart, looking to heaven. As the door opened, and the general entered,
      leaning upon Ebenstreit&rsquo;s arm, followed by his wife, Marie approached them
      with a haughty, determined manner, who regarded her with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, slowly and calmly, &ldquo;I am ready to follow your wishes.
      Send for the clergyman: I consent to marry this man to-day, upon one
      condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it known, my dear Marie. Name your condition. I will joyfully fulfil
      it,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I demand that we leave to-day for the East, to go to Egypt&mdash;Palestine&mdash;and
      remain away from this place for years. Are you agreed to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To all that which my dear Marie wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can now weave the bridal-wreath in my hair, mother. I consent to the
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three hours later the preparations were completed. Every thing had awaited
      this for three months.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sitting-room, the decorators had quickly built a marriage-altar,
      and ornamented the walls with garlands of flowers, with festoons of gauze
      and silk, with flags and standards. The mother wore the costly silk which
      her rich son-in-law had honored her with for the occasion, and also
      adorned herself with the gold ornaments which were equally his gift. The
      father wore his gold-embroidered uniform, and imagined himself a stately
      figure, as the gout left him the use of his limbs this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invited witnesses began to assemble. Just then Ebenstreit von Leuthen
      drove up in the handsome travelling-carriage, which was a wedding-gift to
      his wife, and excited the admiration of the numerous street public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Trude, in her simple dark Sunday dress, had awaited the appearance of
      the bridegroom, and went to announce his arrival to the bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie was in her little garret-room, so unlike in its present appearance
      to its former simplicity and comfort&mdash;as unlike as the occupant to
      the rosy, smiling young girl, who, yonder by the little brown table in the
      window-niche, taught her pupils, or with busy, skilful hands made the
      loveliest flowers, the income of which she gave to her parents, joyfully
      and although she never received thanks or recognition for the same. Now
      the same little table was covered with morocco cases, whose half-open
      covers revealed brilliant ornaments, laces, and sweet perfumes; superb
      silk dresses, cloaks, and shawls, ornamented with lace, lay about upon the
      bed and chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herr Ebenstreit von Leuthen had truly given his bride a princely dowry,
      and her mother had spread the things around room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Marie gave her consent to the marriage, she had followed out their
      wishes without opposition. She wore a white satin dress, covered with gold
      lace, her arms, neck, and ears, adorned with diamonds. The coiffeur had
      powdered and arranged her hair, without her ever casting a glance into the
      Psyche-mirror which her betrothed had had the gallantry to send to her
      room. She let him arrange the costly bridal veil; but when he would place
      the crown of myrtle, she waved him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your work is finished,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;my mother will place that, I thank
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Trude entered, Marie was standing in the centre of the room, regarding
      it with sinister, angry looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are, Trude,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am glad to see you a moment alone,
      for I have something to tell you. I have spoken with my future husband,
      demanding that you live with me as long as I live. Immediately after the
      ceremony you will go to my future home and remain there as house-keeper
      during my absence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sadly the old woman shook her head. &ldquo;No, that is too important a place for
      me. I will not lead a lazy life, and play the fine woman. I was made to
      work with my hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what you will in the house,&rdquo; answered Marie. &ldquo;Only promise me that you
      will not leave me, and when I return that I shall find you there. If you
      leave me, I will never come back. Promise me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will promise you, my poor child,&rdquo; sighed Trude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie laughed scornfully. &ldquo;You call me poor&mdash;do you not see I am
      rich? I carry a fortune about my neck. Go, do not bewail me&mdash;I am
      rich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie, do not laugh so, it makes me feel badly,&rdquo; whispered the old woman.
      &ldquo;I came to tell you the bridegroom and the clergyman are there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The time has arrived for the marriage of the rich and happy bride. Go,
      Trude, beg my mother to come up and adorn me with the myrtle-wreath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Marie, can I not do it?&rdquo; asked Trude, with quivering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not you; touch not the fatal wreath! You have no part in that! Call
      my mother&mdash;it is time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trude turned sadly toward the door, Marie glancing after her, and calling
      her back with gentle tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trude, my dear, faithful mother, kiss me once more.&rdquo; She threw her arms
      around Marie&rsquo;s neck and imprinted a loving kiss upon her forehead,
      weeping. &ldquo;Now go, Trude&mdash;we must not give way; you know me; you well
      understand my feelings, and see into my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman went out, drying her eyes. Marie uttered her last farewell.
      &ldquo;With you the past goes forth, with you my youth and hope! When the door
      again opens, my future enters a strange, fearful life. Woe to those who
      have prepared it for me&mdash;woe to those who have so cruelly treated me!
      They will yet see what they have done. The good angel is extinct within
      me. Wicked demons will now assume their over me. I will have no pity&mdash;I
      will revenge myself; that I swear to Moritz!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother rustled in, clothed in her splendid wedding-garments. &ldquo;Did you
      send for me, dear Marie?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother&mdash;I beg you to put on my myrtle-wreath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How! have you no endearment for me?&rdquo; she asked, smilingly. &ldquo;Why do you
      say &lsquo;you&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;thou?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is better so, mother,&rdquo; she coldly answered. &ldquo;Will you adorn me with
      the bridal-wreath?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willingly, my dear child; it is very beautiful and becoming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize, mother, what you are doing? You place the wreath to
      consecrate me to an inconsolably unhappy life with the man that I hate and
      despise!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVIII. OLD FRITZ.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The war terminated, the hostile armies returned to their different German
      countries. Frederick the Great had gained his point, forcing Austria to
      renounce the possession of Bavaria. The Prince of Zweibruecken had been
      solemnly recognized by him as the rightful heir to the electorate, and the
      lawful ruler and possessor of Bavaria. The Emperor Joseph had submitted
      with profound regret and bitter animosity to the will of his mother, the
      reigning empress, and consented to the peace negotiations of Baron von
      Thugut. Having signed the document of the same, in his quality of
      co-regent, he angrily threw aside the pen, casting a furious glance at the
      hard, impenetrable face of Thugut, saying: &ldquo;Tell her majesty that I have
      accomplished my last act as co-regent, and I now abdicate. From henceforth
      I will still lie her obedient son, but no submissive joint ruler, to only
      follow devotedly her imperial will. Therefore I resign, and never will
      trouble myself in future about the acts of the government.&rdquo; The emperor
      kept his word. He retired, piqued, into solitude, wounded in the depths of
      his soul, and afterward travelled, leaving the government entirely to the
      empress and her pious confessors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bavaria was rescued! It owed its existence to the watchfulness, sagacity,
      and disinterested aid of Prussia&rsquo;s great king. The Elector Maximilian
      vowed in his delight that he, as well as his successors and heirs, would
      never forget that Bavaria must ascribe its continuance to Prussia alone,
      and therefore the gratitude of the princes of this electorate could not
      and never would be extinguished toward the royal house of Prussia.
      Frederick received these overflowing acknowledgments with the calmness of
      a philosopher and the smile of a skeptic. He understood mankind
      sufficiently to know what to expect from their oaths; to know that in the
      course of time there is nothing more oppressive and intolerable than
      gratitude, that it soon becomes a burden which they would gladly throw off
      their bent shoulders at any price, and become the enemy of him to whom
      they had sworn eternal thankfulness. Frederick regarded these oaths of
      Bavaria not as a security for the future, but as a payment on account of
      the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not go forth to render the Bavarian princes indebted to me,&rdquo; said
      he, to his only confidante, Count Herzberg, as he brought to him, at
      Sans-Souci, the renewed expression of thanks of the prince elector. &ldquo;I
      would only protect Germany against Austria&rsquo;s grasp, and preserve the
      equilibrium of the German empire. Believe me, the house of Hapsburg is a
      dangerous enemy for the little German principalities, and if my successor
      does not bear it in mind, and guard himself against their flatteries and
      cat&rsquo;s-paws, Austria will fleece him as the cat the mouse who is enticed by
      the odor of the bacon. Prussia shall be neither a mouse in the German
      empire, nor serve as a roast for Austria. But she shall be a well-trained
      shepherd&rsquo;s dog for the dear, patient herd, and take care that none go
      astray and are lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty has drawn an unfortunate character for the future of our
      country,&rdquo; sighed Herzberg, thoughtfully, &ldquo;and I must grant that it is
      sketched with severe but correct outlines so it follows that poor Germany
      has many combats and hardships in store.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked the king. &ldquo;What characteristic did I name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty pointed out Austria as the cat watching for prey in Germany.
      Prussia, on the contrary, as the shepherd&rsquo;s dog, which should watch the
      native herd, and occasionally bite those who wander from the flock. The
      comparison is apt, and clearly exposes the natural hostility of the two
      nations. Nature has placed the cat and the dog in eternal enmity, and
      there is no compromise to be thought of, to say nothing of friendship.
      There may, now and then, be a truce; the cat may draw in her claws, and
      the dog may cease to howl and growl, but the combat will renew itself, and
      never end, but in the death of one party, and the victorious triumph of
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said the king, nodding slightly. &ldquo;From this natural
      hostility will proceed many combats and storms for our land, and much
      blood will be shed on its account. Let us look to the future, and try to
      ward off the coming evil, in erecting high barriers against the cat-like
      springs of the enemy. I will think out a security for Germany. But first,
      mon cher ami, we have to care for our own country and people. The war has
      greatly injured my poor subjects. Industry is prostrated and prosperity
      disturbed. We must seek new sources of acquisition, and sustain those
      which are exhausted. For this, we must think of fresh taxes, and other
      sources of income.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Herzberg, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;the taxes are already so
      heavy that it will be difficult to increase them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are greatly mistaken,&rdquo; cried the king, with increased animation. &ldquo;I
      will impose a tax upon those things which are now exempt, and establish a
      capable administration for the purpose. Bread, flour, meat, and beer, the
      sustenance of the poor, shall remain as they are, for I will not that they
      shall pay more. But tobacco, coffee, and tea, are superfluous things,
      which the prosperous and rich consume. Whoever will smoke, and drink tea
      or coffee, can and shall pay for being a gourmand!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, but it is just these taxes which will create the greatest
      discontent,&rdquo; answered Herzberg. &ldquo;Your majesty will remember that the duty
      on coffee was complained of and criticised by every one, and the poor
      people grumbled more than all. In spite of the resistance of government,
      coffee has become, more and more, a means of nourishment and refreshment
      for the lower class.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will teach them to renounce it,&rdquo; cried the king, striking the table
      violently with his staff &ldquo;I will not suffer so much money to go out of the
      country for this abominable beverage! My people shall re-learn to drink
      their beer, instead of this infamous stuff, as I had to do when a young
      man. What was good enough for the crown prince of Prussia, will to-day
      suffice for his subjects. I tell you, Herzberg, I will teach them to drink
      their beer, or pay dearly for this bad, foreign stuff. Then we will see
      which will conquer, Prussian beer or foreign coffee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is possible that the former will be victorious on account of their
      poverty and the high duties; but in any case the people will be
      discontented, and grumble against your majesty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose that I care for that?&rdquo; asked the king, with a quick, fiery
      glance at the calm, earnest face of his confidant. &ldquo;Do you think that I
      care for the applause of the people, or trouble myself about their
      complaints? I regard their shouting or their grumbling about as much as
      the humming or buzzing of a fly upon the wall. If it dares to light upon
      my nose, I brush it off; and if I can, I catch it. Beyond that, it is its
      nature to hum and buzz. Herzberg, you understand that if a ruler should
      listen to the praises or discontent of his subjects, he would soon be a
      lost man, and would not know his own mind. The people are changeable as
      the weather; to-morrow they crush under their feet what to-day they bore
      aloft, and praise one day what they stone the next. Do not talk to me
      about the people! I know this childish, foolish mass, and he is lost who
      counts upon their favor. It is all the same to me whether they like or
      hate me. I shall always do my duty to my subjects according to the best of
      my knowledge and ability, as it becomes an honorable and faithful officer.
      As the chief and most responsible servant of my kingdom, I should be
      mindful to increase her income and diminish her expenses&mdash;to lay
      taxes upon the rich, and lighten them for the poor. This is my task, and I
      will fulfil it so long as I live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Herzberg, with enthusiasm, &ldquo;would that the entire nation might
      hear these words, and engrave them upon their hearts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that, mon cher?&rdquo; asked Frederick, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;I do not
      ask to be deified; my subjects are perfectly welcome to discuss my acts,
      so long as they pay me punctually, and order and quiet are respected and
      preserved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All that is done,&rdquo; said Herzberg, joyfully. &ldquo;The machine of state is so
      well arranged, that she has fulfilled her duty during the war, and will
      soon reestablish prosperity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Particularly,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;if we rightly understand the art of
      agriculture. In the end every thing depends upon him who best cultivates
      his field. This is the highest art, for without it there would be no
      merchants, courtiers, kings, poets, or philosophers. The productions of
      the earth are the truest riches. He who improves his ground, brings waste
      land under the plough, drains the swamps, makes the most glorious
      conquests over barbarism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those are also conquerors, sire,&rdquo; said Herzberg, smiling, &ldquo;who drain
      the mental swamps, and improve the waste mental ground. Such are those who
      increase the schools and instruct the people. I have caused the school
      authorities to report to me, according to your majesty&rsquo;s command. A happy
      progress has been noticed everywhere. Cultivation and education are
      advancing; and since our teachers have adopted the principles of Rousseau,
      a more humane spirit is perceptible throughout our schools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What principle do we owe to Jean Jacques?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, the principle that man is good by nature!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, mon cher, who says that knows but little of the abominable race to
      which we belong!&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: The king&rsquo;s words.&mdash;See &ldquo;Prussia.&rdquo;
       vol. iv., p. 221.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not believe in this doctrine?&rdquo; asked Herzberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king raised his large blue eyes musingly to the busts placed upon the
      bookcases, and around the walls. They lingered long upon those of Homer,
      Plato, and D&rsquo;Alembert; then turned to that of Voltaire, with its
      satyr-like face. &ldquo;No, I do not believe it,&rdquo; he sadly responded. &ldquo;Mankind
      is an ignoble race; still one must love them, for among the wicked are
      always some worthy ones, whose light beams so brightly clear, that they
      change night into day. During my life I have learned to know many base,
      miserable creatures, but I have become reconciled to them, as I have also
      found some who were virtuous and excellent&mdash;some who were noble and
      beautiful, as the grains of wheat among the chaff. You belong to the
      latter, my Herzberg; and as in heaven many unjust will be forgiven for one
      just person, so will I upon earth forgive on your account the Trencks,
      Schaffgotschs, Goernes, Voltaires, Wallraves, Glasows, Dahsens, and all
      the traitors, poisoners, and perfidious ones, as they may be called.
      Remain by my side and sustain me, to prevent many a wicked thing and bring
      to pass much that is good. I shall always be grateful to you in my heart
      for it; that you can depend upon even if my weather-beaten face looks
      ill-humored, and my voice is peevish. Remember that I am a fretful old
      man, who is daily wasting away, approaching that bourne from which no
      traveller has ever returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant that your majesty may be far removed from this bourne!&rdquo; said
      Herzberg, with emotion. &ldquo;And He may grant it on account of your subjects,
      who are so much in need of your care and government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one upon earth who could not be replaced,&rdquo; said the king,
      shaking his head. &ldquo;When I am gone, they will shout to my successor. I
      trust my subjects will exchange a good ruler for their fretful old king. I
      have been very well satisfied with him during the campaign, and he has
      shown ability in the diplomatic mission to St. Petersburg. He has proved
      himself a soldier and a diplomat, and I hope he will become a great king.
      Herzberg, why do you not answer me, but cast down your eyes? What does
      your silence mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all&mdash;truly nothing! The crown prince has a noble,
      generous heart, a good understanding; only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why hesitate, Herzberg? Go on&mdash;what is your &lsquo;only?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would only say that the crown prince must beware and not be governed by
      others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean that he will be ruled by mistresses and favorites?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do fear it, your majesty! You well know that the crown princes are
      generally the antipodes of those ascendant to the throne. If the ruler has
      only an enlightened mind, and is free from prejudices, so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his crown prince an obscurer,&rdquo; added quickly the king, &ldquo;having the
      more prejudices, and is capable of being ruled by mystics and exorcists.
      Is not that your meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count Herzberg nodded. The king continued with animation: &ldquo;Some one has
      told me of a new friend who returned from the war with the prince, and who
      belongs to the Rosicrucians and exhorters, and hopes to find many
      adherents here for such deceptions. Is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire. It is Colonel Bischofswerder, a Rosicrucian and necromancer
      and of course of very pleasant address. He has indeed already gained much
      power over the impressible mind of Frederick William, and his importance
      is greatly on the increase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the crown prince&rsquo;s mistress say to it? Is she not jealous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of which one does your majesty speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king started, and his eyes flashed. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he cried with vehemence,
      &ldquo;is there a question of several? Has the crown prince others besides
      Wilhelmine Enke, whom I have tolerated?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, unfortunately, the prince has not a very faithful heart. Besides,
      it is Bischofswerder&rsquo;s plan, as I suppose, to separate him from
      Wilhelmine, who will not subordinate herself to him, and who even dares to
      mock the necromancers and visionaries, and oppose them to the crown
      prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Enke do that?&rdquo; asked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sire,&rdquo; answered Herzberg, as the king rose and slowly paced the
      room. &ldquo;And one must acknowledge that in that she does well and nobly.
      Otherwise one cannot reproach her. She leads a quiet, retired life, very
      seldom leaving her beautiful villa at Charlottenburg, but devotes herself
      to the education of her children. She is surrounded with highly-educated
      men, savants, poets, and artists, who indeed all belong to the
      enlightened, the so-called Illuminati, and which are a thorn in the eye to
      Colonel Bischofswerder. Your majesty will perceive that I have some good
      informants in this circle, and the latest news they bring me is that the
      bad influence is upon the increase. The Rosicrucians reproach the prince
      for his immoral connection with Wilhelmine Enke, as they would replace her
      by one who gives herself up to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shall not take place,&rdquo; cried the king. &ldquo;No, we will not suffer that;
      and particularly when we are forced to recognize such abominable
      connections, we should endeavor to choose the most desirable. I cannot
      permit that this person, who has at least heart and understanding, should
      be pushed aside by Bischofswerder. My nephew shall retain her, and she
      shall drive away the Rosicrucians with all their deviltries. Herzberg, go
      and tell the crown prince, from me, that I order&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His majesty suddenly stopped, and looked at Herzberg with surprise, who
      was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you laugh, Herzberg?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not laughing, sire. If my lip quivered against my will, it was
      because I stupidly and foolishly dared to finish the broken sentence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how did you manage to conclude it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, your majesty said, &lsquo;Tell the crown prince that I order him&rsquo;&mdash;and
      there you ceased. I added &lsquo;order him to love Wilhelmine Enke, and be
      faithful to her.&rsquo; I beg pardon for my mistake. I should have known that
      your majesty could never command the execution of that which is not to be
      forced; that my great king recognizes, as well as I, that love is not
      compulsory, or fidelity either. Pardon me for my impertinence, and tell me
      the order which I shall take to the crown prince from my beloved king and
      master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king stepped close up to the minister, and gazed with a half-sad,
      half-tender expression in the noble and gentle face of Herzberg, and in
      the sensible brown eyes, which sank not beneath the fiery glance of
      Frederick. Then, slowly raising his hand from the staff, he menaced him
      with his long, bony forefinger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Herzberg, you are a rogue, and will teach me morals. Indeed, you are
      right&mdash;love is not compulsory, but one can sometimes aid it. Say
      nothing to the prince. The interior of his house must, indeed, be left to
      himself, but we will keep our eyes open and be watchful. Do so also,
      Herzberg, and if you discover any thing, tell me; and if Wilhelmine Enke
      needs assistance against the infamous Rosicrucians, and with her aid this
      mystic rabble can be suppressed, inform me, and I am ready to send her
      succor. Ah! Herzberg, is it not a melancholy fact that one must fight his
      way through so much wickedness to obtain so little that is good? My whole
      life has passed in toil and trouble; I have grown old before my time, and
      would rest from my labors, and harvest in the last few years, what I have
      sown in a lifetime. Is it not sad that I hope for no fruit, and that the
      seed that I have scattered will be trodden under foot by my successor? I
      must gaze at the future without joy, without consolation!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king turned to the window, perhaps to hide the tears which stood in
      his eyes. Herzberg did not presume to interrupt the sad silence, but gazed
      with an expression of the deepest sympathy at the little bent form, in the
      threadbare coat. Grief filled his heart at the thought that this head was
      not only bowed down by the weight of years and well-deserved laurels, but
      also from its many cares and griefs, and hopeless peering into the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king turned again, and his eyes were bright and un-dimmed. &ldquo;We must
      never lose courage,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and we must have a reserve corps in life as
      well as upon the field of battle. For the world resembles the latter, and
      the former is a continual war, in which we must not be discouraged nor
      cast down, if there is not hope in our souls. I will cling to As you have
      said, and I have also found it true, that crown prince is a good and brave
      man, and possesses a keen understanding, we may succeed in bringing him
      from the erroneous ways in which his youth, levity, and the counsels of
      wicked friends have led him. We will try with kindness and friendliness,
      as I believe these have more effect upon him. Let us not even scorn to aid
      Wilhelmine in so far as is compatible with honor. If a mistress is
      necessary to the happiness of the prince, this one seems the most worthy
      of all to encourage. Beyond the clouds the stars are still shining, and it
      appears to me as if I see in perspective in the heaven of Prussia&rsquo;s
      future, a star which promises a bright light with years. Do you not think
      with me, the little Prince Frederick William is a rising star?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your majesty,&rdquo; answered Herzberg, joyfully, &ldquo;He is a splendid little
      boy, of simple and innocent heart, and bright, vigorous mind, modest and
      unpretending.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; cried the king, evidently cheered, &ldquo;there is one star and we
      will watch over it, that it is not obscured. I must see the prince
      oftener. He shall visit me every month and his governors and teachers
      shall report to me every quarter. We will watch over his education, and
      train him to be a good king for the future, and guard ourselves against
      being pusillanimous, foolish, and fretful, and not be discouraged in life.
      I have entered my last lustrum, or five years. Hush! do not dispute it,
      but believe me! My physique is worn out, and the mental grows dull, and
      although I live and move about, I am half in the grave. There are two
      coffins in this room, which contain the greater part of my past. Look
      around, do you not see them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Herzberg, as he glanced at the different articles of furniture,
      &ldquo;I see none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look upon the table by the window&mdash;what do you there see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty, there is an instrument-case and a sword-sheath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are the ones I refer to. In the case lies my flute, that is to say,
      my youth, love, poesy, and art, are encoffined there. In the sheath is my
      sword, which is my manhood, energy, laurels, and fame. I will never play
      the flute or draw the sword again. All that is past!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there still remains for the great king a noble work to perfect,&rdquo;
       cried Herzberg. &ldquo;Youth has flown, and the war-songs are hushed. The poet
      and hero will change to the lawgiver. Sire, you have made Prussia great
      and powerful externally; there remains a greater work, to make her the
      same within. You have added new provinces, give them now a new code of
      laws. You will no longer unsheath the sword of the hero; then raise that
      of justice high above your subjects!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; cried the king, with beaming eyes. &ldquo;You have rightly seized and
      comprehended what alone seems to me worthy of will and execution. There
      shall be but one law for the high and the low, the poor and the rich. The
      distinguished Chancellor Carmer shall immediately go to work upon it, and
      you shall aid him. The necessity of such a reform we have lately felt in
      the Arnold process, where the judge decided in favor of the rich, and
      wronged the poor man. How could the judge sustain Count Schmettau against
      the miller Arnold, who had been deprived of the water for his mill, when
      it was so evident that it was unjust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg pardon, majesty, but I believe the judge obeyed the very letter of
      the law, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then this law must be annulled,&rdquo; interrupted the king. &ldquo;This is why I
      revoked the judge&rsquo;s sentence, and sent the obstinate fellows to the
      fortress, sustaining the miller in his right deposing the arrogant
      Chancellor Furst. I had long resolved upon it, for I knew that he was a
      haughty fellow, who let the poor crowd his anteroom, and listened to the
      flattery of the high-born rabble who courted him. I only waited an
      occasion to bow his haughty head. This offered, and I availed myself of
      it, voila tout. It is to be hoped that it will be good example for all
      courts of justice. They will remember that the least peasant and beggar is
      a human being as much as the king, and that justice should be accorded to
      if they do not, they will have to deal with me. If a college of justice
      practises injustice, it is more dangerous than a band of robbers; for one
      can protect himself from the latter but the former are rascals wearing the
      mantle of justice, to exercise their own evil passions, from whom no man
      can protect himself, and they are the greatest scoundrels in the world and
      deserve a double punishment. I therefore deposed the unjust judge, and
      sent him to the fortress at Spandau, that all might take warning by his
      fate.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: The king&rsquo;s own words.&mdash;Seo &ldquo;Prussia, Frederick
      the Great,&rdquo; vol. iv.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Arnold trial belongs to history,&rdquo; said Herzberg. &ldquo;The lawyers will
      refer to it after the lapse of centuries, and the poor and the oppressed
      will recall and bless the thoughtfulness of the great king, who would open
      just as wide a gate for them to enter the heaven of justice as to the rich
      and noble. This new code of laws will beam above the crown of gold and of
      laurels, with the splendor of the civil crown, whose brilliants are the
      tears of gratitude of your people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May it be so,&rdquo; said Frederick, with earnestness. &ldquo;Now tell me, do you
      know what day of the month it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, it is the 30th of May.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you will remember it is the anniversary of Voltaire&rsquo;s death, and
      after I have quarrelled for two years with the priests and so-called holy
      fathers at Rome, I have gained my point, and the honor shall be shown him
      here in Berlin which the priests and friars have refused to the immortal
      poet in his own country. To-day, exactly at the hour which Voltaire died,
      the mass for the dead will be read in the Catholic church, to free his
      immortal soul from purgatory. I have, indeed, no idea of an immortal soul.
      If there are any, and if it has to endure the threefold heat of which
      Father Tobias, of Silesia, related to me, I do not believe that the
      priests, for a few thalers, can loose the unhappy spirit from the
      bake-oven. But as they refuse burial to the spirit of Voltaire, in order
      to insult him after death, so must I avail myself of this occasion to
      offer a last homage to the great poet, which will take place at four
      o&rsquo;clock. Go to the mass, Herzberg, and tell me to-morrow how it went off&mdash;whether
      the priests make right pious faces and burn much incense. Adieu. Au
      revoir, demain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the king dismissed, with a friendly wave of the hand, his confidential
      minister, he passed into his cabinet, remaining an hour with his
      counsellors. At dinner appeared some of the generals, weather-worn and
      bent, with wrinkled faces and dull eyes. Souvenirs of the glorious years
      of fame and victory. The king nodded kindly to them, but during the entire
      meal, he only let some indifferent questions fall from his lips, which
      were devotedly and tediously answered by some one of the old generals. As
      their dry, peevish voices resounded through the high, vaulted room, it
      seemed to reawaken in Frederick&rsquo;s heart the souvenirs of memory and become
      the echo of vanished days. He gazed up at the little Cupids, in the varied
      play of bright colors, looking down from the clouds, and the goddesses
      trumpeting through their long tubes the fame of the immortal, the same as
      formerly, when they smiled from the clouds upon the beaming face of the
      young king, dining in the distinguished circle of his friends Voltaire,
      D&rsquo;Argens, Algarotti, La Melbrie, and Keith.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cupids were fresh as ever, and the goddesses had not removed the
      trumpets from their lips. But where were the of the merry round-table?
      Returned to dust. The jests and poesy have died away&mdash;all have sunken
      to decay and darkness. The king silently raised his glass of Tokay, gazing
      up to the clouds and Cupids, draining it slowly in sacrifice for the dead.
      Then with a vehement, contemptuous movement, he threw the glass over his
      shoulder, shivering it into a thousand pieces. The old generals, after
      dessert, had gently sunk into their afternoon nap, and now started,
      frightened, looking wildly around, as if they expected the enemy were
      approaching. Alkmene crept from under the king&rsquo;s chair muffing with her
      long, delicate nose, the glistening pieces of glass, and the footman bent
      himself to carefully pick them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king rose silently, saluting the old generals, pointing with his staff
      to the large folding-doors which led to the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footmen hastened forward to open them, and stand in stiff, military
      order upon each side. Frederick walked slowly out, mounting the two steps
      which led to the upper terrace, signing to the attendants to close the
      doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was alone. Only Windspiel was there to spring about joyfully, barking,
      and turning to meet him, who wandered on the border of the terrace, where
      he had formerly walked with his friends. Now he stopped to gaze up the
      broad, deserted steps which led from terrace to terrace, as if he could
      re-people them with the well-known forms, and could see them approach and
      greet him with the look of endless love and constancy. Then he raised his
      eyes to heaven, as if to seek there those he in vain sought upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not see me, my friends?&rdquo; he asked, in a gentle but sad voice. &ldquo;Do
      you not look down wonderingly where you saw a cheerful, smiling king, upon
      the now bent, shrunken old man, cold and phlegmatic, who seldom speaks,
      and then causes every one to yawn? Oh, where have you fled, beautiful
      spring-time of life&mdash;wherein once we used to enliven our
      conversations with the wit of the Athenians, and the jest fluttered upon
      our lips as we glided through life in the bold enjoyment of youth?
      Banished is the dance, and I creep about, leaning upon my staff, enfeebled
      in body, and with saddened heart! Oh, awful change, unhappy old age! What
      does it aid me that I am a king? I have won many a battle, but now I am
      vanquished by age and death and am alone!&rdquo; <i>[Footnote: The king&rsquo;s words.&mdash;See
      &ldquo;Posthumous Works,&rdquo; vol. x., p. 100.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight breeze rustled through the trees, fanning, caressingly, the
      cheeks of the king. The perfume of sweet flowers rose from the terrace,
      and below rushed the cascade. The marble groups around the fountain
      glistened in the golden rays of the sun, and in the dark foliage fluttered
      and sang the merry birds of summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the wind wafted from the church at Potsdam the clear tones of a
      bell, announcing to the king the hour of four, the death of Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king walked along to the rose-arbor, to the temple of friendship,
      where the bust of his sister Frederika was placed. He seated himself near
      the entrance, listening to the ringing voice of the bell, and recalling
      that the death-mass had now commenced in Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service sacred to memory! The prayer for the immortal soul! As the
      lonely king sat there, calm and bowed down, a solemn prayer and holy mass
      rose from his own soul. He bowed lower his head, and, without realizing it
      himself, traced letters in the sand at his feet, with no witness but the
      blue heavens above him, and Windspiel who curiously eyed the lines.
      Thinking of the prayer for Voltaire&rsquo;s undying soul, the king had written
      the word of profoundest mystery and revelation, of hope and prophecy&mdash;&ldquo;Immortality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wind gently rustled in the trees, wafting the perfume of flowers.
      Sweet stillness reigned around, and lowly sang the birds as if not to
      waken the king, who slept by the marble form of his beloved sister&mdash;Windspiel
      upon his knees, and in the sand at his feet the word traced by his own
      hand, &ldquo;Immortality.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIX. CAGLIOSTRO&rsquo;S RETURN.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine Enke was still living at her villa at Charlottenburg. She was,
      as formerly, the &ldquo;unmarried&rdquo; daughter of the hautboy-player, the favorite
      and friend of the crown prince; the same as two years previous, when he
      presented her before the Bavarian campaign, with this house and There was
      no change in her outward circumstances; her life passed regularly and
      calmly. The once fresh and beautiful cheek had lost somewhat of its
      youthful, roseate hue, and the smile of the ruby lips was less haughty,
      and the warmth of those brilliant eyes was subdued. This was the only
      perceptible difference wrought by the little vexations and troubles
      incident to her position. She had found some bitter drops in the golden
      goblet which the prince in his love pressed to her lips&mdash;drops which
      were uncongenial to lips accustomed to the sweets of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day she had awaited him at dinner, and had just received a very
      friendly but laconic letter, excusing himself until the following morning.
      This was an unpalatable drop. Wilhlemine paced back and forth the
      solitary, gloomy path, at the foot of the garden, re-reading this letter,
      and examining every word to search out its hidden meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have brought this about,&rdquo; she murmured, tearing the letter into
      little pieces, which lighted upon the shrubbery like butterflies. &ldquo;Yes, it
      is their work. They have sought by all possible means to draw him into
      their power, and away from me. And they will succeed, as there are two of
      them, and the princess sustains them; and I am alone, unsupported. I am
      entirely alone&mdash;alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are alone, then, it is surely your own fault,&rdquo; said an earnest,
      solemn voice, and at the same instant a tall form approached from the
      shrubbery which bordered the side of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cagliostro!&rdquo; shrieked Wilhelmine, shrinking terrified away. &ldquo;Oh, mercy
      upon me, it is Cagliostro!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so frightened, my daughter?&rdquo; he asked, gently. &ldquo;Why do you
      withdraw from me, and cast down your eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were in Courland,&rdquo; she stammered, confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And whilst you thought me afar, you forgot your sacred oath and holy
      duty,&rdquo; he replied, in a harsh, severe tone. &ldquo;Oh my daughter, the
      Invisibles weep and lament bitterly over you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am curious to see these tears,&rdquo; said Wilhelmine, who had now recovered
      her self-composure. &ldquo;Do you think, Herr Magus, any of them could be found
      in the eyes of Colonel Bischofswerder and his intimate friend Woellner? Do
      you pretend that they also weep over me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do not belong to the Invisibles, but the Visibles. But their souls
      are true and faithful, and would have to mourn over the unhappy one who
      could forget her vows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then allow me to say that I abjure these tears, and laugh at the idea
      that these hypocrites and necromancers weep over me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My daughter, what words are these, and how strangely altered you are! I
      have come from the far north, and but just alighted from the
      travelling-carriage. I came at once to see you, and hoped to be greeted
      joyfully with a kiss of love, and what do I hear instead? Harsh words
      filled with scorn and mockery, and disobedience against the Invisible
      Fathers, to whom you have sworn fidelity and submission!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forced me to it!&rdquo; she cried, impetuously. &ldquo;In my own house you
      came upon me and compelled me to take part in your mystic assembly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If one loves humanity, he must insist upon its accepting happiness,&rdquo; said
      Cagliostro, solemnly. &ldquo;We recognized in you one of the elect, one of the
      great souls which are worthy to see the light, and sun themselves in the
      rays of knowledge. Therefore we accepted you among the spirits of the
      alliance, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And made great promises, of which not one has been fulfilled. Where is
      the title of countess, the influence, position, honor, and dignity, which
      you prophesied to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the deeds you promised to perform, the witnesses of your
      fidelity and devotion?&rdquo; he thunderingly demanded. &ldquo;You have dared to rebel
      against the holy alliance! Your short-sighted spirit presumes to mock
      those eyes which perceive that you are straying away! Beware&mdash;Wilhemine,
      beware! I came to-day to warn you, when I return it will be to punish you.
      Turn, oh turn while there is yet time! Submit your will to the Fathers, as
      you have sworn to do! The promised reward will not fail, and Wilhelmine
      Enke will become a countess, a princess, and the most distinguished and
      powerful will bow before her. The Fathers demand of you repentance, and
      renunciation of the worst enemies of the Rosicrucians. Members, and even
      chiefs and pioneers of the Illuminati and Freemasons are welcomed at your
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should they not be?&rdquo; asked she, smiling. &ldquo;They are happy, cheerful
      spirits, void of mysteries, and do not torture people with mysticisms.
      They have but one aim, a great and glorious one, to free the mind from
      superstition and hypocrisy. They encounter with open countenance the false
      devotees who would force men into spiritual servitude, that they may
      become the slaves of their will. You call them &lsquo;Illuminati,&rsquo; while they
      have undertaken to illuminate the minds with the beams of knowledge which
      the Rosicrucians obscure in a mystical fog.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unhappy one, do you dare to say that to me?&rdquo; cried Cagliostro,
      menacingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she responded, keeping her large, brown eyes firmly fixed upon
      Cagliostro&rsquo;s angry face. &ldquo;That I dare to repeat to you, and I would also
      remark that we are not in the mystical assembly of the Rosicrucians, and
      your familiar &lsquo;Du&rsquo; is out of place. I belong to the Illuminati, and mingle
      with the freethinkers. They have not, indeed, promised me titles, honors,
      or dignities, but they have amused me, have driven ennui from the house,
      and instead of mysticisms, brought me poesy, and instead of the invisible
      holy church, the Greek temple. It is possible my life may not be a godly
      one, but it is as happy as the gods, and that is something in this tedious
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regard you with astonishment,&rdquo; said Cagliostro, &ldquo;for I recognize in
      your countenance that the devil has won you over to his power, and in you
      he speaks with the bold insolence of the sinful. Subdue, unhappy child,
      your rash speech, that the Fathers may not hear of it, and crush you in
      their wrath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not fear their thunderbolts, permit me to tell you. We are in
      Prussia; the great king watches over all his subjects; neither the Romish
      Church nor the Rosicrucians can obscure the light of knowledge. He will
      not suffer a ghost, sneaking in the dark, to exercise power here, and he
      will not refuse the protection to me which is accorded to the least of his
      subjects. I do not fear you, and I will tell you the truth entire, I
      believe you to be a hypocrite and a charlatan, who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserable one!&rdquo; interrupted Cagliostro, as he furiously rushed to her,
      seizing her by the arm&mdash;&ldquo;cease, unhappy one, or your life is
      forfeited to the invisible avengers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine shook her head, and encountered his flaming eyes with a proud
      glance. &ldquo;I repeat your own words&mdash;cease, or your life will be
      forfeited! Perhaps you think I do not know what happened to you in Mittau,
      where you were recognized as a charlatan, who fooled the poor creatures
      into the belief of his miraculous acts, which consisted in lightening
      their purses to the benefit of his own. You were obliged to flee from
      Mitlau in the night, to save yourself, your treasures, and wonderful
      man-traps, and the beautiful Lorenza Feliciana. Beware! The Empress of
      Russia had a certain Joseph Balsamo pursued, who had practised great
      deception, and people pretend that he resembles Count Cagliostro. The
      Empress Catherine is a good friend and ally of the King of Prussia, and if
      the happy idea should occur to me to propose seeking the necromancer here,
      the Great Kophta might come a miserable end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, it would only be a welcome occasion for the Great Kophta
      to reveal himself, and hurl his despicable, malicious enemy into the dust
      at his feet,&rdquo; replied Cagliostro, calmly. &ldquo;Try it, you faithless, fallen
      daughter of the Invisibles&mdash;try to unloose the pack of my enemies, to
      recognize that all their yelling and barking does not trouble the noble
      stag to whom God has given the whole world for His forestward that He
      should rule therein. I have listened to you unto the end, and I regard
      your invectives and accusations as not worthy of a reply or justification,
      and I laugh at your menaces. But I warn you, Wilhelmine Enke, defy not the
      Invisibles, and offend not the Holy Fathers, by your continued resistance.
      Turn, misguided child of sin&mdash;turn while there is yet time! In their
      name I offer you a last chance, their forbearance is without bounds, and
      their mercy long enduring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I neither desire your forbearance nor mercy,&rdquo; cried she, proudly. &ldquo;I will
      have no companionship with my enemies, and the Rosicrucians are such, for
      Bischofswerder and Woellner both hate me, and would put me aside. There is
      no reconciliation where only hostility is possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The heavenly listen not to the voices of the earthly, and prove
      themselves, the most noble when the least deserved. They will protect and
      watch over you, even against your will, and never will they be deaf to
      your cry for aid in the hour of Here is a token of their grace toward you.
      Take this ring&mdash;do you recognize it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine regarded it attentively. &ldquo;This is the ring which I gave at the
      tribute-altar instead of gold, which you desired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Invisibles sent it to you to-day as the precious pledge of their
      favor. You shall keep it, and wear it as a token of their heavenly
      forbearance, and when you turn back from the erroneous ways into which the
      Illuminati have led you, send it to the circle of Berlin directors, either
      Bischofswerder or Wollner, and they will come to your rescue. Farewell! I
      forgive you all your wicked words, which fall like spent arrows from the
      helmet of my righteousness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cagliostro turned proudly away, and disappeared in the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine placed the ring upon her finger, turning it to watch the play
      of colors. &ldquo;I do not know why,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;but it has not the same
      brilliancy as formerly. I will take it to the jeweller Wagner, and ask him
      if it is the same stone. Perhaps the Great Kophta has tried some of his
      miracles upon it. I will at once send the servant to Minister von
      Herzberg, and inform him that Cagliostro is here. He has promised me
      protection in the name of the king, and I feel that I shall now have need
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hurried to the house, and devoted herself to the writing of the said
      letter&mdash;a task she was but little accustomed to. She had learned to
      speak French very prettily, and to express herself skilfully and wittily
      in German, and under her royal master, the crown prince Frederick William,
      gained much valuable scientific knowledge. But to write fluently was quite
      another thing, and it was a long time before the epistle was finished.
      However, happily accomplished, she commanded the servant to take it to
      Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed with silent submission; but once having quitted the house, a
      cunning smile was visible upon his face, and he availed himself of a
      stage-coach which was going in the same direction. &ldquo;I can afford this
      expense,&rdquo; said he, arranging himself comfortably. &ldquo;When I have money in my
      pocket why should I walk the long distance? I was very clever to tell
      Bischofswerder that the Minister von Herzberg had secretly visited my
      mistress, and it was equally clever of him to give me a louis d&rsquo;or, and
      promise me the same every time that I should bring him important news.
      Indeed, I think to-day he may well thank me, and I believe, if I often
      inform him, he will advance me a degree, and at last I shall be admitted
      to the circle of the elect, while I now belong to the outside circle, who
      know nothing and hope every thing.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX. THE TRIUMVIRATE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Wilhelmine&rsquo;s servant gave himself up to his hopes, slowly down the
      broad avenue, an elegant four-in-hand carriage rolled past him, and
      stopped at the house where lived Colonel Bischofswerder, long before he
      had reached the Brandenburg Gate. A gentleman sprang out, hastening past
      the footman into the house, where a servant evidently awaited his arrival,
      and preceded him with devout mien, throwing open the wide folding-doors
      and announcing, in a solemn voice&mdash;&ldquo;His excellency, Count
      Cagliostro.&rdquo; He then respectfully withdrew, bowing profoundly as the count
      passed, and closed quickly and noiselessly the doors behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen within hastened to meet the count, who nodded smilingly,
      and extended to them with a gracious condescension his white hand
      sparkling with diamonds. &ldquo;My dear brothers,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have
      unfortunately announced me the truth&mdash;Wilhelmine Enke is faithless&mdash;is
      an apostate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A courtesan, ensnared by the devil of unchastity,&rdquo; murmured the elder of
      the two&mdash;a man of long, lank figure, pale, pock-marked face, the
      broad high forehead shaded with but little hair, the watery blue eyes
      turned upward, as if in pious ecstasy, and the large, bony hands either
      folded as if in prayer, or as if in quiet contemplation, twirling his
      thumbs around each other. &ldquo;I have always said so,&rdquo; said he, with a
      long-drawn sigh; &ldquo;she is a temptress, whom Satan, in bodily repetition of
      himself, has placed by the prince&rsquo;s side, and his salvation cannot be
      counted upon until this person is removed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, my beloved brother, think otherwise&mdash;do you not?&rdquo; asked
      Cagliostro, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Bischofswerder, &ldquo;you know well, sublime master and ruler,
      how much I esteem and love the worthy and honorable Wollner, and how much
      weight his opinion has with me. In all my reports to the Invisible Fathers
      I have always particularly mentioned him, and it was upon my wish and
      proposal that they appointed him director of one of the three Berlin
      circles. He is occupied near me in the confederacy, and is also in the
      service of the crown prince, for it was by my especial, earnest
      recommendation that his highness called him to Berlin from the exchequer
      of Prince Henry at Rheinsberg, that he might give him lectures in politics
      and other branches of administration, I do not say it to boast, although I
      have always regarded it as an honor to have opened the way to a
      distinguished man, to have his great talents properly valued. I only say
      it to prove my high appreciation of dear brother Wollner, and to defend
      myself, master, in your eyes, that I differ in opinion from him, and do
      not advise a violent removal of this person, to whom the prince is more
      attached than he himself knows of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not necessary to excuse yourself to me, my son,&rdquo; said Cagliostro,
      pompously. &ldquo;The eyes which the Invisibles have lighted up with a beam of
      revelation, see into the depths of things, and reveal the most hidden. I
      have glanced into your hearts, and I will tell you that which I have
      therein read. You, Hans Rudolph von Bischofswerder, belong to the world;
      its joys and sorrows agitate you. You have a longing for science and the
      knowledge of the Invisibles, and you would also enjoy the Visibles, and
      take part in the pleasures of life. What you would allow yourself, that
      you would also grant to your royal master, whose friend and leader you
      are, and who, one day, will be the future king and ruler of the visible
      world, and a faithful son and servant of the Invisibles. Is it not thus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is so,&rdquo; answered Bischofswerder, who, with wondering astonishment,
      drank in every word that fell from Cagliostro&rsquo;s lips as a revelation. &ldquo;You
      have read the inmost thoughts of my heart, and what I scarcely suspected
      myself, you are knowing of, lord and master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toil and strive, my son, and you shall rise to the highest grade, in
      which presentiment and recognition, thinking and knowing, are one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He extended to Bischofswerder his hand, who fervently pressed it to his
      lips; then turned to Wollner, who, with upturned gaze and folded hands,
      might have been praying, for his thumbs were not turning around, but
      rested, quietly crossed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, my son and brother,&rdquo; continued Cagliostro, with his lofty, haughty
      reserve, &ldquo;your thoughts are diverted from earth, and the joys of this
      world have no charm for you!&rdquo; &ldquo;I have laid the oath of virtue and chastity
      upon the altar of the Invisibles,&rdquo; replied Wollner, with a severe tone of
      voice. &ldquo;I have given myself to a pious life of abstinence, and sworn to
      employ every means to lead those that I can attain to upon the narrow path
      which leads to the paradise of science, of knowledge, and heavenly joys.
      How could I forget my oath, which is to win the prince, who is to become a
      light and shield in the holy order, from the broad course of vice, to the
      pathway of the blest? How can I bear to see him lost in sin who is elected
      to virtue, and who longs for the light of knowledge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, in order to bear the light in its brightness, he must have passed
      through the darkness and gloom of sin,&rdquo; said Cagliostro. &ldquo;After the days
      of error follow those of knowledge. This is what causes the mildness of
      our brother Theophilus, whom the earthly world calls Bischofswerder,
      whilst you, brother Chrysophorus, demand from the prince the severest
      virtue, which is the first great vow of the brothers advancing in the holy
      order of the Rosicrucians. You are both wrong and both right. It is well
      to be lenient as brother Theophilus, but that must have its limit, and the
      night wanderer who stands upon the brink of a precipice must be awakened,
      but not with violent words, or calling loudly his name, because a sudden
      awakening would only hasten his fall. Slowly and carefully must he be
      roused; as one would by degrees accustom the invalid eyes to the mid-day,
      so must the light of virtue and knowledge dawn upon the eyes, ill from
      vice, with prudent foresight. Hear my proposal. Summon the three circles
      of the brothers of the highest degree to a sitting to-night. You have told
      me that the prince desires to belong to the seeing ones, and be in
      communion with the spiritual world. This night his wish shall be
      fulfilled, to see the spirits, and a new future shall rise before him. My
      time is limited; let us arrange every thing, for the voices of the
      Invisibles already call me home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant a modest knocking was heard at the door, which was
      repeated at different intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my servant,&rdquo; said Bischofswerder, &ldquo;and he has undoubtedly an
      important communication for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door, speaking with the person outside in a low tone, and
      returned with a sealed note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cagliostro, apparently, was lest in deep thought and indifferent to the
      conversation without, directing quietly and calmly, in the mean time, a
      few questions to Wollner, and, as it seemed, listening only to his
      answers. Yet as Bischofswerder approached him, saying, &ldquo;it is, indeed,
      important news; I have proof in hand that&mdash;&rdquo; he interrupted him with
      a commanding motion, and finished the broken sentence: &ldquo;&mdash;that
      Wilhelmine Enke is a powerful adversary, having connection with the court,
      as this letter from her is directed to Minister Herzberg. Is it not this
      that you would say, Theophilus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Astonished, he replied in the affirmative, begging his master to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unnecessary,&rdquo; replied Cagliostro, waving back the letter; &ldquo;to the
      seeing eyes every thing is revealed. This person announces to Minister von
      Herzberg that the deceiver and necromancer, Cagliostro, in his flight from
      Mittau, has visited her to menace her. She begs protection for herself and
      an arrest for me; that I am known as Count Julien, at the hotel King of
      Portugal, at Berlin, and that haste is necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both gentlemen glanced astonished and enraptured, first at the sealed
      epistle and then at the great Magus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open the letter and convince yourselves of the contents!&rdquo; commanded
      Cagliostro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is unnecessary,&rdquo; cried Bischofswerder, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;We recognize
      in you truth and knowledge; you have revealed to us the contents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, there is a lingering doubt in the mind of brother Chrysophorus!&rdquo;
       said Cagliostro, regarding Woellner fixedly, who stood with downcast eyes
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My ruler and master,&rdquo; stammered Woellner, in confusion, &ldquo;I dare not
      doubt, only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would only be convinced, open then the letter,&rdquo; interrupted
      Cagliostro, sarcastically.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sharp knife, Bischofswerder cut the end of the envelope, and handed
      the letter to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to Chrysophorus,&rdquo; commanded the count. &ldquo;He shall read it, and may
      the incredulous become a believer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Woellner perused the epistle with a slightly tremulous voice, stopping now
      and then, at an illegible word, which his master quickly supplied to him,
      finishing the sentence as correctly as if he held the writing in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contents were exactly as Cagliostro had given them, and the farther
      Wollner read, the more his voice quivered and Bischofswerder&rsquo;s enthusiasm
      increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the reading was finished, the former sank, with uplifted hands, before
      his master, as if imploring mercy from a mighty, crushing power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been unbelieving as Tobias, doubting as Paul; have mercy on me, O
      master! for in this hour the divine light of belief and knowledge banishes
      doubt from my sinful heart. I acknowledge thy supernatural power and
      heavenly wisdom! My whole being bows in humility before you and your
      sublimity, and henceforth I will only be your humble scholar and servant,
      the tool of your will. Forgive me, all-knowing one, if my heart doubted.
      Breathe upon me the breath of knowledge, and lay thy august right hand
      upon my head, and penetrate me with thy heavenly power.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have mercy upon me also,&rdquo; cried Bischofswerder, as he kneeled beside
      Woellner, and, like him, raised his hands imploringly to Cagliostro.
      &ldquo;Breathe upon me the breath of thy grace, and regard me, the repentant and
      unworthy, with thy heavenly glance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cagliostro looked to heaven, and from his lips there fell disconnected
      words of exhortation; suddenly he drew forth his hands, which he had
      pushed into his gown and crossed upon his breast, stretching them out with
      wide-spread fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me, ye spirits!&rdquo; he cried, in a loud, thundering voice. &ldquo;Ye
      spirits of fire and air, come to me! Ye shall flame and burn upon the
      heads of these two persons and announce to them that the Invisibles are
      with us. Come to me, ye spirits of fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He clinched his fingers, extending them again, and upon the points there
      danced and flickered a blue light. A heavenly smile shone upon the
      beautiful face of the Magus, his hands slowly sank upon the heads of the
      kneeling ones, the flames gliding upon their heads, resting there a
      moment, and then dying away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Invisibles have proclaimed themselves to you through the sign of
      fire,&rdquo; cried Cagliostro. &ldquo;The sacred flame has glowed upon your heads, and
      I now press upon your brow the solemn kiss of consecration and knowledge!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed down to the kneeling ones. It seemed as if a cloud of perfume had
      passed over their glowing faces, or as if an odorous lily had been pressed
      upon their foreheads, and their hearts quivered with delight. He passed
      his hand lightly over their faces, and a feeling of rapture spread through
      their whole being. Then as he commanded them to rise, they obeyed, without
      realizing that they had limbs or body, but regarded the miracle-worker,
      entranced with his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cagliostro, with hasty decision and earnest, commanding air, made a few
      opposite strokes in the air, and immediately the faces of the magnetized
      looked as if they had awakened from a dream of splendor and delight to
      insipid, flat reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have permitted you to behold, for an instant, the mysteries and
      miracles which are serviceable to the knowing ones,&rdquo; said Cagliostro, with
      calm earnestness. &ldquo;Your souls were in communion with the Invisibles, and
      from the source of knowledge a spark of illumination fell upon your heads.
      Guard it as a heavenly secret that no one should know of, and now let us
      continue our conversation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me once more to lay my head at your feet, and receive power from
      the touch thereof,&rdquo; implored Bischofswerder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me embrace your knees, and entreat pardon and grace,&rdquo; begged
      Woellner, as he sank down to clasp them, and the former threw himself at
      the feet of his master, passionately kissing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smilingly he received their homage, and assisted them to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now let us speak in a human, reasonable manner, my friends. Brother
      Theophilus, you, first of all, return the letter to the envelope and seal
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bischofswerder obeyed; taking from the table a little bottle and a small
      brush, he carefully applied an adhesive substance to the edges, pressing
      them firmly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Master, no one could discover that it had been opened. Command what shall
      be done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it to your servant, that he may return it to him who brought it, and
      the latter can now deliver it at its address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Minister Herzberg!&rdquo; they both cried, amazed. &ldquo;It is impossible; he
      is a sworn enemy of the holy order and your own heavenly person. He could
      take the most violent measures, and cause your excellency to be arrested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; smiled Cagliostro. &ldquo;The great Frederick would announce
      triumphantly that he had had the great Semiramis of the North taken, which
      the Russian police had failed to accomplish. It would be a welcome triumph
      for unbelievers and fools, and they would trumpet it joyfully through the
      world! It must not be; although my spirit in its power and might would
      soon release my body, yet I will not grant this momentary triumph to my
      enemies. My time is limited; I must forth to Egypt, where the Brothers of
      the Millennium will assemble in the course of a week in the pyramids, to
      announce to me their will for the coming century. I am the Spirit of God,
      which the Invisibles have willed to enter a human form, therefore it must
      be regarded as sacred and protected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Allow me to guard, with my life, your sublime person!&rdquo; cried
      Bischofswerder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also implore you to grant me the happiness to watch over the
      security of your heavenly self, and defend it to the last drop of my
      blood!&rdquo; cried Woellner; &ldquo;only tell us what we have to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Above all things obey my command concerning the letter,&rdquo; replied the
      count, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bischofswerder submissively went out with the epistle, returning in a few
      moments. &ldquo;It is as you have ordered: in a quarter of an hour it will be in
      the hands of Minister Herzberg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the count, fixing his eyes upon empty space, &ldquo;it will not be
      there, for Herzberg is not at home. I now see him driving in a carriage
      with four black steeds to the country. At this instant he is crossing a
      bridge, now he enters a town, turning down one of the streets, where the
      noise of the wheels is lost. Again I hear him, leaving by the gate,
      ascending a broad avenue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the route to Sans-Souci,&rdquo; murmured Bischofswerder, in a low voice,
      but the count must have understood him, as he repeated aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is the route to Sans-Souci, and the lonely, fretful old king
      will keep his minister the entire day, and will not receive the missive
      from his secret female accomplice until his return in the evening, and
      then he will dispatch his bailiffs in all haste to the hotel to arrest
      Count St. Julien, and forward an order to every gate to forbid his
      departure. It will be too late, however&mdash;he will have already
      departed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Departed!&rdquo; cried the two gentlemen, frightened. &ldquo;Will you, then, forsake
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, my brothers, be quiet!&rdquo; answered Cagliostro. &ldquo;I shall have departed
      for the profane, but I will remain here for the consecrated until
      to-morrow morning. It oft happens that the lofty even must come down, and
      the brilliant obscure themselves. To-day I must descend from my spiritual
      height, and humble myself in the dust of lowliness. When the unholy and
      unconsecrated essay to behold that which they should not with their
      earthly eyes; they must be blinded with earthly dust, and for those which
      are not worthy of miracles, we must sometimes condescend to jugglers&rsquo; 
      tricks. By the latter I will mislead my enemies to-day. How many gates are
      there to the city of Berlin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are nine, master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send immediately messengers around in your circles to order eight
      travelling-carriages and sixteen large black trunks. Further, send me
      eight confidential discreet men of my height and size, with eight perukes,
      exactly the cut of mine. Command four post-horses, with two postilions for
      eight different addresses. This is all that is necessary for the moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All shall be faithfully and quickly accomplished,&rdquo; said Bischofswerder,
      humbly. &ldquo;We will divide the execution of your orders, and there only
      remains to appoint the time and place when and where to direct the
      postilions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this will follow; forget not, in trifling, earthly things, the great
      heavenly circumstances. Summon the consecrated of the highest degree of
      your circle to go to-night to the palace of Prince Frederick William at
      Potsdam, and under the very eyes of the old freethinking king we will open
      to the crown prince the doors of the spiritual world, and consecrate him
      to the highest degree. But first the Invisibles shall speak with him, and
      announce the heavenly region of the unapproachable. Finish the
      preparations, my brothers&mdash;fulfil exactly and punctually my orders,
      and then come to the hotel to receive my last commands.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXI. FUTURE PLANS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Cagliostro quitted the two confidants, entered his carriage awaiting him
      before the door, and drove to the hotel. The host and chief waiter
      received him with extreme deference, both accompanying him up the stairs&mdash;the
      latter throwing wide open the large doors of his room. The count turned,
      and, in addressing some indifferent question to the host, opened his
      gold-embroidered blue satin vest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host turned pale, and shrank back, as if seized with a sudden fright.
      Cagliostro passed on, motioning him to follow, which he humbly obeyed,
      sinking upon his knees as the door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you recognized the sign which I wear upon my breast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, master,&rdquo; he stammered, bowing down with the greatest reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you belong to the elect of the Inner Temple, for the sign of
      knowledge is only made known to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do, indeed, understand its mysteries, master, and I know that one of
      the Invisibles, in infinite condescension, appears in a visible form
      before me. Immeasurable as the happiness, is my obedience! Command me,
      master; my life and riches belong to the holy alliance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rise and receive my orders,&rdquo; replied Cagliostro, with great dignity. In a
      brief, dictatorial manner he communicated the necessary arrangements; then
      dismissed him with a haughty nod, and entered the adjoining room of his
      wife, Lorenza Feliciana.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had thrown herself upon the divan, in charming neglige. Her head was
      encircled with black ringlets, which she wore unpowdered, despite the
      fashion. Her eyes were closed, and her beautiful shoulders were but half
      concealed by a black lace veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slept so quietly and soundly that the count did not awaken her upon
      entering. He approached her lightly upon the soft carpet, and stood
      regarding her attentively. A pleasant smile spread over his face,
      softening its expression, and his eyes beamed with passionate tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is indeed beautiful,&rdquo; he murmured, softly. &ldquo;No one could withstand
      the charm of this wonderful woman. Ah, would that I could crush these
      wicked spirits within me, silence all these seductive, sinful voices, and
      fly to some secluded valley of our dear fatherland, and there, reposing on
      her love, let life glide calmly on and smile at the past without regret,
      as a fading dream! Would that I could forget, and become again pure and
      innocent, blest in my affection, simple in my tastes, and without wants!
      But no, it is too late! I cannot retreat, the demons will not be driven
      out; to them my soul belongs, and I must fulfil my destiny!&mdash;Awake,
      Lorenza, awake!&rdquo; Her beautiful form shook with fright; she started, opened
      her eyes, demanding, &ldquo;What is the matter? Who is here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I, Lorenza,&rdquo; he said, sadly; &ldquo;I was obliged to awaken you, to tell
      you something important.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the pursuers here? Have they discovered us? Are they coming to take
      us to prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no; be quiet, Lorenza, no one has discovered us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; she repeated, with a scornful laugh. &ldquo;We have travelled day and
      night the last ten days, hiding ourselves in miserable holes and dens,
      under assumed names, believing our pursuers were at our hacks; and now
      that we are showing ourselves publicly, you ask me to be quiet! I have
      slept for the first time since that fearful night in Mittau, and it is
      very cruel and thoughtless of you to wake me, if the bailiffs are not
      here, and danger does not menace us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For the moment we are safe, but I have something important to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Important?&rdquo; she cried, shrugging her shoulders. &ldquo;What is of consequence
      to me, since that night? Oh, when I think of it, I could shriek with rage,
      I could annihilate myself in despair!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was indeed a dreadful experience, and my heart quakes when I think of
      it,&rdquo; said Cagliostro, gloomily. &ldquo;The secret assembly consisted of the
      highest and most influential of the Courland nobility. Suspecting no
      wrong, not even that there could be traitors among the believers who would
      falsify my spirit apparatus, I gave myself up to conjuring the departed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I upon my fairy throne,&rdquo; added Lorenza, &ldquo;couched in the innocent
      costume of the celestial, only veiled with a silvery cloud, heard a sudden
      shriek. The room was quite dark; I saw, upon opening my eyes, that no
      spirits enlivened it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every thing failed&mdash;that is to say, my assistants let it fail,&rdquo; said
      the count, &ldquo;and the assembly began to murmur. Suddenly, instead of the
      departed princes and heroes, what fearful forms arose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Apes, cats, and other animals,&rdquo; cried Lorenza, with a loud laugh. &ldquo;Oh,
      what an irresistible sight! In spite of my anger I had to laugh, and laugh
      I did upon the fairy throne, like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like a foolish child who neither knows nor understands danger,&rdquo;
       interrupted the count. &ldquo;Your laughing soon ceased in the fearful tumult
      and uproar. They shrieked for light, the ladies fled, and the men menaced
      me with loud curses, calling me a charlatan, and threatening my life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine also,&rdquo; cried Lorenza; &ldquo;oh, what insults and ill-treatment I was
      forced to listen to! They rushed upon me, shrieking for the brilliants and
      money which they had brought me as an offering. How they scolded and
      called me a deceiver! I was only very beautiful and coquettish, and that
      was no deception! I charmed them with my coyness, and they brought me the
      most costly presents, because I was a virtuous woman. Now they reproached
      me, demanding a return of them all, which they had forced upon me of their
      own free will. I was obliged to bear it silently in my costume of
      innocence, and as goddess I could not defend myself and speak with human
      beings&mdash;who pushed up to the throne. It was a very ridiculous
      position; happily I did not quite lose my senses, but let the apparatus
      play, and disappeared into my dressing-room below, which fortunately
      closed above me. I dressed, and rushed to your room to rescue my
      treasures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even in this extreme danger you only thought of your riches, not of me,&rdquo;
       said Cagliostro, with a bitter smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not taught me yourself that money was the only thing worth
      striving to possess? Have you not revealed to in wisdom that riches alone
      make us happy, and procure for us honor, power, love, and constancy? Ah!
      Joseph, have you not made me the miserable, heartless creature that I am?
      Can you reproach me that your teaching has borne such good fruit? I am
      happy to be the priestess of wealth, and grateful for what you have made
      known to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; sighed Cagliostro, &ldquo;I have taught you the truth of things; I
      have disclosed to you the world&rsquo;s motive power. Riches are indeed the god
      upon earth, toward whom all are pressing, rushing on. We must all follow
      and serve him as slaves, or be crushed under the wheels of his triumphal
      car. Men talk and reason about the storm and pressure which is spreading
      through the world, and finally will reduce every thing to storm the
      eternal and undying bliss of wealth, and press on for gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think that we have lost every thing!&rdquo; cried Lorenza, springing up and
      stamping with her silken-shod foot; &ldquo;every thing is lost that I have been
      years gaining, by hypocrisy, deception, and coquetry. They have robbed me!
      The shameful barbarians have seized all our effects. The police surrounded
      the house, guarding every entrance, and we were obliged to escape by the
      roof into the house of one of the brothers, leaving all our treasures
      behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You exaggerate, Lorenza, and represent it worse than it is. Look around;
      you are surrounded with luxury and comfort. Our great undertakings in
      Courland and St. Petersburg have failed, it is true, and the Russian
      empress has ordered me to be driven away and pursued. But the Invisible
      Fathers have not forsaken me, as they know that I am a useful tool in
      their hands. They have carefully provided me with money, passports, and
      instructions. We have lost thousands, but we will regain them, for the
      future is ours. I am protected by the order, and called to a new and
      important mission in Paris, to strive for the sacred aim of the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have they no mission for me?&rdquo; asked Lorenza. &ldquo;Is there nothing
      further for me to do in that city than to be a beautiful woman, and play
      tricks for my dear husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great events await you in Paris, which we will aid you to prepare. The
      Invisible Fathers send you before me to the Cardinal de Rohan. You are
      going to Paris in the service of the revolution of minds. The carriage is
      ordered, and you are to set off this very hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when are you going, Joseph?&rdquo; Lorenza asked, with a touch of
      melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall officially depart in an hour, but in reality at the same time
      that the Baroness von Balmore leaves the hotel in her travelling-carriage.
      Near the waiting-maid will a servant sit upon the box. I shall be he.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Officially you depart in an hour; what does that mean?&rdquo; Cagliostro
      smiled. &ldquo;It is a long story and a comical one. Come, seat yourself by me
      upon the sofa; repose your head upon me, and listen to what I will relate
      to you.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXII. MIRACLES AND SPIRITS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon of the same day a travelling-carriage drove up
      before the hotel &ldquo;King of Portugal,&rdquo; in the Burgstrasse, with two large
      black trunks strapped upon it behind the footman&rsquo;s box, and the postilion,
      sitting by the coachman, playing the beautiful and popular air, &ldquo;Es ritten
      drei Reuter cum Thore hinaus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count St. Julien descended the stairs, followed by the host, and nodded in
      a lofty manner to the two waiters and hostler awaiting him at the
      entrance, who returned it by a profound bow, at the same time not failing
      to see the white hand extended with the trinkgeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host himself closed the carriage door, and the count departed amid the
      merry peals of the postilion, the former gazing after him with the
      satisfaction of one who has made a good bargain. The servants watched it,
      too, until it had disappeared around the corner of the next street.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the quivering tones of a post-horn were heard, and an open
      caleche appeared and stopped before the hotel with two large black
      travelling-trunks upon it, and the postilion upon the box blowing the
      popular air, &ldquo;Es ritten drei Reuter zum Thore hinaus!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The host observed the empty carriage with a smile, but the servants asked
      themselves astonished what it meant, and as they turned and saw Count St.
      Julien descending the stairs, they were startled. He offered them the
      usual trinkgeld, entered the carriage, and rolled away with a commanding
      nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host seemed speechless with astonishment, and stood as if rooted to
      the spot. The servants stared after the carriage until it turned the
      corner; when just then a post-horn was heard playing the agreeable melody
      of &ldquo;Drei Reuter,&rdquo; and a travelling-carriage with two large black trunks
      drove up to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants turned pale, looking shyly toward the stairs. Slowly and with
      great dignity Count St. Julien descended, greeting them with a gentlemanly
      nod as he passed, and, extending his white hand with a trinkgeld, mounted
      his carriage, and drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host stood as if stunned, outside the door, looking right and left
      with unspeakable terror. The servants tremblingly fixed their eyes upon
      the stairs, no longer possessing the power to move, but heard the
      post-horn, and the carriage which drove up to the door the third time.
      Slowly and proudly Count St. Julien advanced. It was the same cold, grave
      face, with the thick black beard, and the powdered peruke, the curls of
      which overshadowed the brow and cheeks. He wore exactly the same
      dark-brown cloak over the black velvet dress. The white hand, with broad
      lace wrist-ruffles, reached them also a trinkgeld.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time the fellows had scarcely self-possession sufficient to take the
      present, for every thing swam before their eyes, and their hearts one
      moment almost ceased to beat, and then palpitated with the feverish
      rapidity of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would run away,&rdquo; murmured the chief waiter, as Count St. Julien for the
      fourth time drove away, &ldquo;if my feet were not riveted to the floor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could move mine I would have gone long ago,&rdquo; groaned the second
      waiter, the clear drops standing upon his forehead. &ldquo;It is witchcraft! Oh,
      Heaven! they are coming again, playing the &lsquo;Drei Reuter.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The count descended the stairs for the fifth time, whispered to the
      hostler, who was quite engrossed counting his money, handed the trinkgeld
      to the pale fellows by the door, and mounted his carriage, driving away
      amid the merry peals of the post-horn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julius,&rdquo; murmured the steward, softly, &ldquo;give my hair a good pulling, that
      I may awake from this horrible dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; he whimpered, &ldquo;my hands and feet are lame. I cannot move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the hostler, courageously stretching forth his hand, and
      pulling it so vigorously that the steward was fully convinced of the
      reality of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the post-horn sounded the &ldquo;Drei Reuter;&rdquo; again the carriage stopped
      before the door, and the count descended, giving to every one a gift like
      the &ldquo;Maedchen aus der Fremde,&rdquo; and for the sixth time rolled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are bewitched; it is a ghost from the infernal regions!&rdquo; groaned the
      steward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot abide it any longer&mdash;I shall die!&rdquo; said the second waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not mind it,&rdquo; said the hostler, as he jingled the money; &ldquo;if they
      are ghosts from hell, the eight groschen do not come from there, for they
      are quite cool. See how&mdash;Ah, there comes the count again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the seventh time he passed down the stairway, by the servants, who
      wore no longer standing but kneeling, which the count received as a proof
      of their profound respect, and slipped the money into their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Praise God, all good spirits!&rdquo; murmured the head waiter; but neither the
      count nor the money seemed to be moved by the pious exhortation, for he
      quietly entered his carriage, and the eight groschen lay in the servant&rsquo;s
      hand, at which the hostler remarked that he would stand there all night if
      the count would only continually pass by with groschen. It pleased the
      count to descend the stairs yet twice more, divide the trinkgeld, and
      mount his carriage. As he drove away the ninth time, it appeared as if the
      Drei Reuter were determined to drive out of the gate and forsake the hotel
      &ldquo;King of Portugal.&rdquo; The host waited awhile, and talked with the neighbors,
      who, roused by the continual blast of the post-horn, were curious to know
      how it happened that so many guests were departing by extra posts.
      Whereupon the host, in a hollow, sepulchral voice, his eyes glaring, and
      shrugging his shoulders, declared that there had been but one gentleman at
      the hotel, but nine times he had seen him drive away, and the devil must
      have a hand in the matter!
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaking his head, he returned to the hotel, and found the servants busily
      counting their money, occasionally casting covetous looks toward the
      stairs, as if they hoped the count would again descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exactly as Cagliostro had foretold, Minister Herzberg did not return from
      Sans-Souci until late in the evening, and then found Wilhelmine&rsquo;s letter
      in his cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the police were instructed to arrest Count St. Julien at the
      hotel &ldquo;King of Portugal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later the chief of the police came to say that the count had
      already been gone two hours. He repeated the account of the host,
      corroborated by the servants, of nine different counts having driven away
      from the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herzberg smiled. &ldquo;We have to deal with a very clever scoundrel,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;and it is no other than the so-called Count Cagliostro, who was lately
      exposed as a bold trickster in Mittau and St. Petersburg, and about whose
      arrest the Empress Catharine is very much exercised. It would be very
      agreeable to the king to show this little attention to her imperial
      highness, and trap the adroit pickpocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We might succeed in catching him in his flight,&rdquo; remarked the chief. &ldquo;For
      the last six months the king has given orders that every passport should
      be examined at the gates, and the route of the travellers noted down,
      which is all registered and sent to the king. It would be very easy to
      discover by which gate he departed, and his route, and then have him
      pursued.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well thought of, director; hasten to put it into execution, and
      inform us of the result.&rdquo; He returned in an hour to the minister&rsquo;s
      cabinet, shaking his head gravely. &ldquo;Your excellency, it is very strange,
      but he is a wizard. This man has driven out of the nine gates at the same
      hour and minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herzberg laughed. &ldquo;This is one of his tricks, and by it I recognize the
      great necromancer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your excellency, this is no trickery, but witchery. It is impossible for
      any one man to drive out of the nine gates at the same hour, in the same
      carriage, with two large black trunks and a postilion blowing the same
      melody, and provided with a correct passport, which he shows and is
      recognized as Count St. Julien, who is going to Paris by Hamburg. Here are
      the nine registers from the different gates, all the same, if I am not
      bewitched and do not read straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This trick does honor to the count,&rdquo; said Herzberg, smiling. &ldquo;To-morrow
      you shall accompany me to Sans-Souci and read aloud the registers to the
      king. Do you think it will be impossible to pursue the count now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be very happy to follow your excellency&rsquo;s judgment in this
      matter, and arrest the rascal in any way that you could point out,&rdquo; said
      the director.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am convinced that he is in the city; and driving put of the nine gates
      at the same time was the best manner to escape being discovered,&rdquo; said
      Herzberg. &ldquo;He is concealed in some one of the houses of the brothers, and
      we shall be obliged to let him escape this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In order the more securely to carry out the initiation of Prince Frederick
      William, in company with Bischofswerder and Woellner, Cagliostro had
      arranged his pretended departure. For a long time the prince had expressed
      an extreme desire to be received into the mysteries of the miraculous and
      holy order, of which he had heard his friends speak with so much
      reverence. But he had been put off from time to time with regrets and
      shrugs of the shoulders, and expressions of the impossibility of granting
      the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spirits do not always appear even to the consecrated,&rdquo; said
      Bischofswerder. &ldquo;They make themselves known after many fervent prayers and
      implorings, and when we have withdrawn from every one who could entice us
      to doubt or disbelief. I fear that it would be impossible to conjure the
      spirits of the departed, so long as your highness honors a certain lady
      with your particular favor, who ridicules the sublime order and mingles
      with its enemies. How can they appear to those who have just been in the
      company of a friend of the Illuminati and unbelievers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spirit-world only reveals itself to the virtuous and pure,&rdquo; said
      Woellner, in a harsh, dry voice. &ldquo;Its inhabitants cannot approach those
      who are not chaste and innocent, for sin and vice surround them with a
      thick fog, which keeps them at a distance from the clear atmosphere of the
      sublime. If you would call up the spirits, you must remove this woman who
      entices you from the path of virtue, and renders the sphere impure around
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Despite the warnings and the great wish the prince had to be received into
      the spirit-world, and become a member of the highest grade of the
      Rosicrucians, he could not resolve to forsake her who had been his friend
      for ten years, and who had borne shame and degradation on his account,
      refusing eligible and rich men rather than leave him and become a
      legitimate wife. Wilhelmine was the beloved of his youth, the mother of
      his two dear children, and she alone knew how to drive away the ennui
      which pursued the prince, with her amiable, subtle wit. Nay, he could not
      be so ungrateful, so heartless, as to reject her who had so tenderly loved
      him when young and beautiful, now that the first bloom of youth and beauty
      had faded!
    </p>
    <p>
      Bischofswerder and Woellner recognized this difficulty, and applied
      themselves the more energetically for its removal. They supposed that the
      unexpected arrival of Cagliostro would very naturally appear to the prince
      as a special messenger, sent, without doubt, from the fathers, to
      accomplish his conversion. They announced to the prince that the
      Invisibles had taken pity upon his desire for knowledge, and had consented
      to permit him to gaze into the regions of the blest, although he wandered
      in the path of vice, and that he must hold himself in readiness to
      accompany the messenger whenever he should be sent to call him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this reason the crown prince had written to Wilhelmine that she should
      not expect him until the following morning, and he did not quit his room
      the entire day, with excited expectation awaiting the summons. As evening
      set in the prince was cast down, and quite of the opinion that the
      Invisibles did not deem him worthy to enter their pure presence, and
      thought that Wilhelmine must be the hinderance. Whilst he was reflecting
      whether to sacrifice his beloved to the salvation of his soul, the secret
      door gently opened, and two men, masked and wrapped in black cloaks,
      entered and placed themselves near the door. The prince did not remark
      their entrance, and was quite frightened as he chanced to turn, and saw
      these two immovable figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      With quivering voice he demanded their mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same tone, as if one were an echo of the other, they answered, &ldquo;We
      desire nothing, but you demand knowledge of the spirit-world, and would
      have its mysteries revealed to you, which the Invisibles will now grant
      you. Follow us, therefore!&rdquo; They reopened the secret door; one of the
      masked preceded the prince, and the other followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince shuddered at the thought that he might be rushing into some
      unknown danger, and intrusting himself to those who would misuse his
      confidence. He demanded to see their faces, declaring himself prepared to
      follow, when acquainted with his guides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would then be better to remain,&rdquo; replied one of the masked. &ldquo;He who
      lacks confidence is not worthy of it, and he who trusts only the Visibles,
      the Invisibles flee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince recognized the voice of Bischofswerder, and smiled, but he knew
      not that it was permitted him to hear it to inspire him with courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so let it be; the fathers shall see that I am a believer,&rdquo; cried
      the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately one of the brothers put his own cloak, three-cornered hat, and
      mask upon his highness, still remaining cloaked and masked himself, much
      to the astonishment of the passive prince. &ldquo;Come, now, the Invisibles
      await you,&rdquo; said one of the masked. The prince stepped courageously into
      the little corridor which led to the secret stairway, one brother
      preceding him, causing a soft light to illumine their path, the other
      following him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In silence they reached the side-door of the palace, where a close
      carriage awaited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you taking me?&rdquo; asked Frederick William, as he entered,
      followed by the two brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Invisibles,&rdquo; answered a strange voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the prince essayed to begin a conversation, his only response being,
      &ldquo;Purify your heart and pray.&rdquo; Silently they galloped over paved and
      unpaved streets, the prince heartily repenting having been drawn into this
      adventure. He thought of his charming and beloved Wilhelmine, and half
      determined to give the command to drive to Charlottenburg. The fact of
      Bischofswerder being with him, and fearful of appearing weak and wanting
      in courage in the eyes of his friend and favorite, prevented him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After several hours&rsquo; drive, they stopped at the marble palace of Potsdam,
      near the one which the prince was accustomed to occupy. His highness
      looked cautiously around, and breathed more freely, as he felt that he was
      now surely among friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The white palace stood silent and deserted in the darkness, this palace at
      Potsdam being only used for the guests of the king. The carriage stopped
      at the side-door, where there was no sentinel, and they alighted, entering
      the palace, winding along the corridors in the same order as before,
      guided by the glimmering light of the one preceding. Solemn music, strange
      ringing sounds, fell upon the ear as they advanced. Sometimes they were
      sharp and cutting as glass, then threatening and penetrating as the wind,
      shrieking and moaning, causing one to be very nervous if not terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farther they proceeded the louder grew the sounds, and at intervals
      groans, moans and wailings were heard, as of those waiting and imploring
      for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the brothers now opened a door, and then placing themselves upon
      each side, the unknown voice announced to the prince that they had arrived
      at the long-sought-for goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have we come here for?&rdquo; asked the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To behold that which you have many times petitioned to be permitted to
      see,&rdquo; replied Bischofswerder, gently encouraging and inspiring Frederick
      William. &ldquo;The Invisibles have at last yielded to your wishes, and the
      spirits which you summon will appear. If your courage fails you, and you
      dread the presence of the departed, command to be reconducted to your
      palace, and we will obey; but renounce forever the sublime happiness of
      beholding the Invisibles and of holding communion with the spirit-world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear not, but wish to be in the company of the spirits,&rdquo; answered the
      prince, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kneel,&rdquo; they commanded, permitting him to enter, &ldquo;and thrice summon in a
      loud voice the names of three departed, who will answer your questions.
      Beware of approaching them, for their glance is death and their breath
      destruction! Therefore remain kneeling, as it becomes a mortal in the
      presence of an immortal. Hope and pray, brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the door closed upon the prince, and he found himself in such
      impenetrable darkness, he sank upon his knees, for he dared not advance,
      and retreat was impossible, in spite of heart-quakings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shrill, penetrating music ceased, and a voice from a distance called:
      &ldquo;Summon thrice those that thou desirest to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marcus Aurelius, Leibnitz, and the distinguished elector,&rdquo; called the
      prince in a loud voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who summoned me?&rdquo; was responded in hollow, sepulchral tones, and directly
      over the crown prince a blue, vaporous light was visible&mdash;at first
      only a cloud, then by degrees increasing and condensing itself into a
      human shape, until it took the form of a Roman warrior of the olden time;
      no other than Marcus Aurelius, in helmet and coat-of-mail, with a pale,
      earth-colored face and glaring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who summoned me?&rdquo; repeated the figure. The prince&rsquo;s lips refused to
      respond, and shuddering he gazed upon the corpse-like face, so exact in
      feature to the old Roman emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You answer me not!&rdquo; thundered the voice, &ldquo;but I will tell you who you are&mdash;one
      lost in sin and an apostate!&mdash;the crown prince of Prussia, a future
      king, who will be called to govern a people, and knows not
      self-government! Turn from the path of vice while it is yet time; rise
      from the dust, that the ashes of retribution do not bury you in a living
      tomb, like the sinful Pompeians. No monument marks the place of the
      sinful; he sinks into the night of oblivion, or he is cursed by succeeding
      generations. Therefore turn from the errors of sin. Rise to virtue, that
      the blessed may approach you. I shudder in your presence. Woe to you! woe!
      woe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cloud-portrait vanished, and darkness reigned for a moment. The prince
      cried in anguish: &ldquo;I will hear no more; this air oppresses me&mdash;open
      the door&mdash;I renounce communion with the spirits; I will go out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The light reappeared in the dark room and another form hovered over the
      prince&mdash;of grave, obscure face, with a great peruke, staring at him.
      He recognized the distinguished philosopher Leibnitz, whom he had desired
      to see, but who now filled him with unspeakable terror. Like the former
      spirit, he also, when unanswered, reproached the erring prince, conjuring
      him to return to virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the menacing ghost disappeared, the prince felt for the door, and shook
      it with the power which terror lends, crying, &ldquo;Open, open!&rdquo; It opened not,
      and the third summoned, the great elector, Frederick William, appeared,
      with high, up-lifted arm, glittering eyes, advancing with angry mien,
      shaking his lion&rsquo;s mane against the erring son of his house, whom he
      menaced with curses and revenge, if he did not renounce the courtesan who
      had seduced him to vice and unchastity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will become better,&rdquo; groaned the prince. &ldquo;I will perform the wish of
      the spirits. Only have mercy on me&mdash;free me. Help! help! Open the
      door, Bischofswerder, I will do better. Open the door!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time it really opened, and a long train of dark, masked forms entered
      the dusky room surrounding the prince, wringing their hands, imploring him
      to turn from sin, and forsake the unholy woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      They whimpered, they implored, sinking upon their knees, beating their
      clinched hands, and weeping: &ldquo;Turn, beloved elect! Renounce Wilhelmine
      Enke; renounce vice! Repulse the seductress, and turn your countenance to
      Virtue which you have seen in all her beauty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will perform that which you demand,&rdquo; wept the prince, as the deathly
      terror and nervous excitement made him yielding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swear!&rdquo; cried the chorus of masks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear that Wilhelmine Enke shall no longer be my mistress. I swear by
      all that is holy that I will renounce her! I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Voice failed him; there was a ringing and buzzing in his ears; every thing
      swam before his eyes, and he sank fainting. The prince awoke after long
      unconsciousness, and found himself upon his bed in the new palace at
      Potsdam, Bischofswerder at his side, watching him with the tenderest
      sympathy. He bent over him and pressed his hand to his lips with a cry of
      delight. &ldquo;Heaven be praised; my dear prince, you have awaked to commence a
      new life! You now belong to the virtuous and honorable, whom the Invisible
      Fathers bless!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true, Bischofswerder,&rdquo; said the prince, languidly, &ldquo;that I have
      sworn to renounce Wilhelmine Enke, and never to love her more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have sworn it by all that is holy, and all in heaven and on earth
      have heard your oath, and there is joy thereat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince turned his head, that Bischofswerder might not see the tears
      streaming down his cheeks.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII. THE RETURN HOME.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The beautiful house which Herr Ebenstreit von Leuthen possessed upon the
      finest street in Berlin, &ldquo;Unter den Linden,&rdquo; had been newly arranged and
      splendidly ornamented since his marriage and elevation to a title, and now
      awaited his arrival. For many weeks mechanics and artists had been busily
      employed; and the good housekeeper, old Trude, saw with bewildering
      astonishment the daily increasing splendor of gilded furniture, costly
      mirrors and chandeliers, soft carpets, tapestries, and gold-embroidered
      curtains, exquisite paintings and statuary, which the possessor had
      forwarded from Italy, and many other objects of art standing upon gilt and
      marble tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every thing was completed. The bustle of the busy workmen had ceased, and
      Trude slowly wandered through the solitary rooms, examining every article.
      Her face bespoke dissatisfaction, and a smile of contempt was visible
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miserable trash, for which they have sold my poor child!&rdquo; murmured the
      old woman. &ldquo;For these worthless, glittering toys have they ruined the
      happiness of the dear innocent heart, and on them the guilt will fall if
      her soul is lost! I remark how she is changed in her letters since her
      shameful, mercenary marriage. She writes of nothing but the arrangement of
      her house, and speaks as if the beauty and costliness of things were only
      to be thought of, and there is not even a confidential, heart-felt word
      for her old Trude. It would seem as if she had forgotten all former
      objects of interest. Oh, what trouble and sorrows the rich have! That
      good-for-nothing money hardens their hearts and makes them evil and
      selfish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The loud ringing of a bell sounded through the solitary drawing-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, undoubtedly, the general&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; said Trude, shaking her head.
      &ldquo;She rings as if she would announce the king, with her nose turned up so
      high, or as if she were the money-sacks of her son-in-law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Trude was right; her shrill voice was heard ordering the steward, who had
      but just arrived. &ldquo;It is abominable, it is unheard of!&rdquo; she cried, as with
      a heavy push she burst open the door; &ldquo;this man presumes to contradict me,
      and&mdash;ah, there you are, Trude!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;were you looking for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and I would ask you if my orders are not the same as if given by
      Herr Ebenstreit von Leuthen or his wife, or have you instructed the new
      steward otherwise, which, it is laughable to say, you have engaged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not instructed him thus. Dear Marie has not ordered it in her
      letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Marie,&rdquo; repeated Frau von Werrig. &ldquo;How can you permit yourself to
      speak so intimately of the rich Baroness von Ebenstreit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true, it is not right,&rdquo; sighed Trude; &ldquo;I beg pardon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came here to see if every thing was in readiness, and ordered the
      steward to ornament the doors and corridors with garlands of flowers; he
      has had the boldness to tell me he dares not do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is right, Frau von Leuthen. Baroness Ebenstreit von Leuthen (have I
      got the title right?) wrote and expressly forbade any festivity to greet
      her arrival. Here is the letter&mdash;I carry it around with me; I will
      read it to you: &lsquo;I expressly forbid any manifestation whatever to be made
      at our return, whether of garlands or flowers, as they are only hypocrisy
      and falsehood. I wish no one there to receive me&mdash;remember, Trude, no
      one! Inform my family that, as soon as I have recovered from the fatigue
      of the journey, I will make them the visit of duty with the baron.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What cold, heartless words are these! One could hardly believe that a
      daughter was writing of her parents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On her wedding-day she perhaps forgot that she had any,&rdquo; said Trude,
      shrugging her shoulders, &ldquo;and she should not be at once reminded of that
      trying occasion on her return. I expect her every moment, as the courier
      has already arrived an hour ago, and it would be better&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot be so impudent as to tell me to leave? Indeed, I will not be
      prevented from waiting to receive my only child that I have not seen for
      three years. One can well believe that a mother would be impatient to
      embrace her dear daughter! I have no other happiness but my beloved child,
      and I long, unspeakably, to press her to my heart and tell her my sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorrow! is it possible that Frau von Werrig has any griefs? I supposed
      there was nothing in the world troubled her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I am very much tormented. I can well tell you, Trude, as you are
      familiar with our circumstances,&rdquo; sighed the countess. &ldquo;You know the
      general is tolerably well; the journeys to Wiesbaden and Teplitz have
      cured him of the gout unfortunately, so that he can go about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sorry for that, Frau von Werrig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I am, Trude, as he has returned to his former habits,
      frequenting the society of drinking-houses and gamblers. Imagine the
      general played yesterday, lost all his ready money, and that was not
      enough, but signed away the year&rsquo;s pension from Herr von Ebenstreit,
      during which time we have nothing but the miserable army annuity to live
      upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your income will be less to live upon than formerly, for dear Marie
      earned something with her flowers and lessons which she gave to you,
      although she was never thanked for it. She was then my dear good Marie, so
      industrious and patient, and worked untiringly for her parents! Then she
      forgot them not, and toiled early and late, and, oh, it breaks my heart to
      think of it, and I must cry in your presence!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised the corner of her dark-blue apron and dried her eyes, holding
      it there as she continued to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an ugly apron!&rdquo; cried the countess, &ldquo;and how meanly you are dressed
      altogether! Is that the way you intend to go looking as the housekeeper of
      a rich and genteel family? Go, Trude, quickly, and put something better
      on, that you may receive your master and mistress in a suitable dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall remain as I am, for I am very properly dressed. It may not be
      suitable for a housekeeper, but it becomes old Trude, and it is my Sunday
      frock, which I always wore when I was maid-of-all-work to you. You may not
      remember it, but dear Marie (I should say Baroness von Ebenstreit) will,
      perhaps, and it may recall her little room in the garret, and then&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then she will at last think, Trude, how we took care of her, and how
      thankful she ought to be to her parents that they married her to a rich
      man. If Marie sees it at last&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget with whom you speak, Frau von Werrig,&rdquo; Trude interrupted her,
      scornfully, &ldquo;and that it does not become you to speak of Marie to old
      Trude, but you should remember her title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, when Baroness von Ebenstreit enters this costly house, she
      must understand that her mother was mindful of her best interests, and
      that she owes all this to her; and you, Trude, must remind her of it, and
      tell her about my dreadful trial with her father, and that it is my
      daughter&rsquo;s duty to release me from it, and beg her husband not to deduct
      the gambling-debt from the pension, but pay it this once. For it would be
      a dreadful injustice to make me suffer for the general&rsquo;s rage for play,
      and show but little gratitude for the riches which I brought her. You will
      tell my daughter all this, Trude, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not tell her any thing at all, Frau von Werrig,&rdquo; interrupted.
      Trude, warmly. &ldquo;May my good genius keep me from that, and burdening my
      conscience with such falsehoods.&mdash;Hark! A carriage is coming, and a
      post-horn sounded. They have arrived!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Trude hurried out just as they drove up to the door. The steward and
      two servants in livery rushed down the steps to assist them to alight, and
      Trude also to greet her favorite, who was now so pale, grave, and chilling
      in her appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large eyes of the lady rested with cold indifference upon the old
      woman, whose eyes were turned to her with the tenderest expression. &ldquo;I
      thank you,&rdquo; she said, coldly. &ldquo;Husband! I beg you to give me your arm.&rdquo;
       Proudly she passed the statuary, and over the soft carpets without
      comment, or even a word for old Trude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward and housekeeper followed the silent couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I take you to your room first?&rdquo; asked Ebenstreit, &ldquo;or will you do
      me the pleasure to look at the newly-arranged drawing-rooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she replied, with indifference. &ldquo;We will first look at the
      drawing-rooms, as we shall probably receive much company this winter, and
      they are of the first importance. You know that I dislike solitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I recall that we are very seldom alone!&rdquo; sighed her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be fearful if we were,&rdquo; replied his wife, with marked
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward just now opened the little door of the ante-room, sparkling
      with chandeliers and mirrors. &ldquo;Ah! this is really beautiful, and well
      chosen,&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit, looking about with an air of great pride and
      satisfaction. &ldquo;Tell me, Marie, is it not worthy of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Glancing coldly around, she replied: &ldquo;It does not please at all. The
      furniture is very costly, and reminds one of the parvenu. Every thing
      recalls the riches of the newly-titled banker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband&rsquo;s brow contracted, but he did not trust himself to contest his
      dissatisfaction with his cold, proud wife, but sought another vent for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are very unkind, Marie. Have the goodness to tell me how you, with
      these severe ideas, can suffer that Trude for a moment should appear
      before us in this poor-looking dress which, indeed, does not recall any
      wealth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frau von Ebenstreit&rsquo;s eyes glanced quickly over the old who, she said, was
      the only object which did not bespeak the gaudiness of newly-acquired
      wealth, but she appeared as the respectable servant of an old and noble
      family in fitting dress. &ldquo;Remain as you are, Trude, and do not let
      yourself be misled by our follies! I&mdash;but what is that I see?&rdquo; she
      cried as the steward opened the next door at the silent nod of her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my beloved children, there you are at last; after three years&rsquo; 
      absence I have the happiness to embrace you, my only daughter,&rdquo; cried Frau
      von Werrig, as she approached them with outstretched arms and an
      affectionate smile, essaying to throw her arms around Marie&rsquo;s neck, who
      waved her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My child, my child,&rdquo; whimpered the mother, &ldquo;is it possible that my
      daughter can receive me thus after so long a separation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning to Trude, Marie asked her, with a reproving look and tone, if she
      had received her letter, or if she had forgotten her express commands that
      no one but the servants should be in the house to receive them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not forget it, my lady, and I have read the orders to Frau von
      Werrig, but she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Knew that this wish had no reference to her, as she is her mother&mdash;Tell
      me, my beloved son, is it not very natural and fitting that I should be
      here to receive you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I find it a matter of course,&rdquo; answered Von Ebenstreit, to whom it
      appeared a relief to find an ally in the mother against his proud and
      beautiful wife. &ldquo;I rejoice to see our dear mother here, and I beg Marie
      will join me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie cast an angry glance toward her husband, which so confused and
      perplexed him, that he looked down. Then advancing toward the
      drawing-room, with her usual cold demeanor, without further comment upon
      the ostentatious furniture, she commanded her husband to follow, who
      obeyed, giving his arm to his mother-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is glorious!&rdquo; he cried, smiling. &ldquo;What splendor, what luxury!
      Tell me, my dear mother, is not this beautiful reception-room very
      aristocratically and appropriately fitted up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think a princess or a queen might be satisfied with it,&rdquo; she
      cried, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Even in royal palaces there is nothing of the
      kind to compare to this gold-embroidered tapestry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baron,&rdquo; said Marie, commandingly, &ldquo;have the kindness to dismiss the
      steward. I wish to speak with you and Frau von Werrig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steward slipped out without waiting to be sent, and Trude stood near
      the door, turning to the young baroness, as if to ask if she might remain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you not hear, Trude?&rdquo; cried the mother, impatiently. &ldquo;Tell her to
      go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain, Trude,&rdquo; said Marie, quietly. &ldquo;You are familiar with the past. I
      have nothing to deny to you; shut the door and stay here.&mdash;And now,&rdquo;
       she continued, as her voice lost its gentleness, when she addressed her
      mother, &ldquo;if it is agreeable to you, I should like to have an understanding
      with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my child,&rdquo; sighed the mother, &ldquo;how strangely altered you are! You
      address me, your mother, as Frau von Werrig, and you speak to Ebenstreit
      in a very formal manner, who has been your dear, faithful husband for
      three years. Oh, my darling son, what does this ceremonious manner mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very first hour, after our marriage, that we were alone my dear Marie
      severely reproved me for having addressed her in an intimate, affectionate
      manner, like the common class, as she called it, and I have never done so
      since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be convinced that I am right,&rdquo; said Marie, calmly, &ldquo;and that it
      does not become two beings, who neither love nor esteem each other, and
      who live in the most ceremonious manner, to address one another with
      endearing epithets. At any rate we are not accountable to any one, and
      Frau von Leuthen must know the relations we bear to each other in the
      so-called marriage, as it is her arrangement for the most part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I pride myself upon it,&rdquo; she cried, with animation. &ldquo;I have brought
      about this marriage, which is good fortune to us, and I hope my daughter
      will prove her gratitude, and my son will show me the affection he has so
      often sworn to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know what my husband may have sworn to you, but permit me to
      say, I do not understand whom you, Frau von Werrig, address as daughter
      here; if you accidentally refer to me, you are in error; I have never
      possessed a mother to love me, although formerly, during long years I
      endeavored with tender assiduity to win a parent&rsquo;s heart. That is long
      past, however. The very day that I married Herr von Ebenstreit I renounced
      all family ties, and resolved to be self-reliant. My husband will witness
      that he has never known me to yield, and that I have always been firm and
      resolute in my decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one would doubt it,&rdquo; replied Ebenstreit, timidly. &ldquo;We had a very
      strange marriage, which scarce deserves the name. We resemble more two
      companions who have joined in business, the one side reluctantly, and the
      other joyfully. I long for a happy married life, which has been quite
      impossible thus far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will be to the end, which you will yet learn; and Fran von Werrig
      should understand it, as she brought about the union, and should not be in
      doubt as to the conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I acknowledge that I am almost speechless and quite paralyzed with that
      which I see and hear. I should doubt that this cold, proud woman before me
      were my daughter, if it were not for the name she bears, and her
      features.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That which you and my husband have caused me to become. He knew that I
      neither loved nor esteemed him, and that a union with him seemed so
      unendurable that I would have sought refuge in death, if I had not vowed
      to support life to attain the aim which I imposed upon myself. That is all
      past; it is the future which we must arrange. I am glad that you are here,
      Frau von Werrig, that we may understand each other once for all; but you
      came against my wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse it, dear Marie. It was the longing of mother&rsquo;s heart
      which led me hither; the love&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cold, contemptuous glance of the large eyes caused the mother to cease,
      and quail before her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short pause Marie continued: &ldquo;I wish to exercise alone and
      unhindered the executive rights of a lady in her own house. Do you
      acknowledge the justice of this, my husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly and unconditionally, dear Marie. You know that I have no other
      will but yours, which is my highest happiness to submit myself to in all
      things, always hoping to gain your love and win your heart; that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That this woman has changed to stone,&rdquo; said Marie, coldly, pointing to
      her mother. &ldquo;As you then recognize me as the mistress of this house, I
      shall avail myself of my just right, and no one can prevent me, for I
      stand alone, absolved from all family ties. By my birth and your riches, I
      shall occupy the position of a woman of the world, and as such I shall
      live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am delighted to hear it, Marie,&rdquo; cried her husband. &ldquo;For this reason I
      have had the drawing-rooms furnished in the most costly manner, and I
      shall be proud to receive the aristocratic society who will come to render
      homage to my wife, as they have done everywhere in Paris, London, Rome,
      Madrid, and St. Petersburg. We have frequented the highest circle in all
      these cities, and they have crowded our drawing-rooms, charmed with the
      beauty, distinguished manners, tone of the world, of your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg of you to make but one subject the sole object of conversation,&rdquo;
       said Marie, harshly. &ldquo;I have said that I will avail myself of the
      privilege, as mistress of this house, of receiving no one whom I do not
      wish to see, and no one can enter without consent. Is it clearly
      understood, husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, somewhat agitated; &ldquo;it is the right of every
      housekeeper&mdash;I understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is also clear to me,&rdquo; cried Frau von Werrig, with difficulty
      suppressing her wrath. &ldquo;But I will await the decisive word, and see
      whether it is possible for a daughter to have the insolent presumption to
      drive he mother from her house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already informed you that I have no mother, and that no one has
      the right to call me daughter. If you await my decision, you shall now
      hear it; you are not included among those that I wish to receive in my
      house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, dear Marie, you are cruel!&rdquo; cried her husband, quite frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a degenerate, good-for-nothing creature!&rdquo; cried the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am so, who has caused it but you, both of you? Who broke my heart,
      and crushed it under foot until it ceased to feel, and turned to stone?
      Bear the consequences of your cruelty and heartlessness! I cannot change
      it, and I repeat, Frau von Werrig has not the right to enter this house,
      or to remain here any longer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Scalding tears fell from the mother&rsquo;s eyes as she shrieked, &ldquo;She drives me
      from her house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only treating you as you behaved to one of the noblest and best of
      men,&rdquo; replied Marie, voice and look betraying her deep feeling. &ldquo;You
      thrust from your door, with scorn and contempt, a man worthy of your
      esteem and recognition, although you knew that my heart was breaking. I am
      only following your example and exercising my just rights, and am less
      guilty than you are, as neither of us has need of the respect or esteem of
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you suffer this, my son? Do you allow any one in your presence to
      treat me so shamefully? After all, it is your house; do speak and exercise
      your right as master here: tell your wife that I am her mother, and you,
      my adopted son, who bears my name, and that I have the just right to come
      here as often as it pleases me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak your mind to Frau von Werrig,&rdquo; said Marie, as Ebenstreit remained
      silent. &ldquo;Decide which shall remain, as one or the other of us must leave;
      you are perfectly free to choose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, naturally, there is no choice left me,&rdquo; replied Ebenstreit,
      despondingly. &ldquo;I declare myself for my wife, of course, who is the noblest
      and proudest beauty in Berlin, and will make my house the centre of
      attraction to the aristocracy, nobility, and wealth. This is my greatest
      pride, and to secure this I wooed my beautiful bride, and have submitted
      to all the sorrow and humiliation which have been my portion. If I must
      choose between the mother and daughter, I naturally prefer the latter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He abandons me also!&rdquo; cried the mother. &ldquo;You are an ungrateful, wretched
      man! You forget that you owe every thing to me, and that without me you
      were a miserable mercenary, whose stupidity and tediousness were the
      ridicule of every one, and you had never gained the entrance to a genteel
      house. What have you now become? A high-born man, whose house every one
      will crowd, and who could even appear at court, as he bears our noble and
      distinguished name. To whom do you owe all this, but to me alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God in heaven, Thou hearest it!&rdquo; cried Marie, solemnly, with uplifted
      arms. &ldquo;She acknowledges that she alone has brought this misfortune upon
      me, and in this hour I stand justified.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, Frau von Werrig,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit, haughtily; &ldquo;you are going too
      far. After my fortune, I thank you for my position. I am certainly of
      insignificant birth, but I am ambitious and rich. I said to myself, &lsquo;Money
      can bring about all that I wish,&rsquo; and you see it has accomplished it. My
      wealth procured me a title, a splendid house, a beautiful wife, and a
      position in society. I acknowledge that you aided me in the carrying out
      of my plans, but you would not have done it, if I had not been in a
      position to pay you. You receive a very considerable annuity from me,
      therefore you cannot accuse me of ingratitude, but must confess that you
      have driven a very good bargain. You must forgive me if I beg of you to
      end this painful scene.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That means that I must leave,&rdquo; said Frau von Werrig, mildly, remembering
      the gambling debt and the annuity. &ldquo;Very well, I will go, and promise you
      never to return, upon two conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the goodness to communicate them,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first is, pay the gambling-debt of my husband, who has played away
      the entire sum you allow us yearly, and do not deduct it from our income.
      The second is, increase your allowance five hundred thalers, without
      letting the general know it, and pay it to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit, terrified. &ldquo;You mistake me for a
      Croesus, whose wealth is inexhaustible. If this expenditure and demand
      increase, my colossal fortune will be entirely wasted, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You exaggerate,&rdquo; interrupted Marie, with a peculiar brilliancy in her
      eyes. &ldquo;Such wealth as yours is never-ending, and the banking business,
      which you are still engaged in under another name, is an inexhaustible
      source of wealth. I beg you to accept these conditions, that we may at
      last be at peace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit, to whom the words of Marie sounded as the
      sweetest music. &ldquo;I will then accord your wishes, and you shall have the
      five hundred thalers for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For me alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for yourself alone, Frau von Werrig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who vouches for the fulfilment of your promise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, Frau von Werrig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no confidence but in a written promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will have it made out, and bring you the document to-morrow
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then our business is finished, and I can go.&mdash;Farewell, baroness;
      this is my last word to you. I cursed you from the moment you came into
      being. If you had been a son, the rich estate in trust of my family would
      have passed to you, of which I was the natural heir. As it was, it went to
      a distant relative, and we received nothing. Therefore your parents could
      not rejoice at your birth, and we only pardoned you when you married a
      rich man, who could free us from want, and now the separation is no grief
      to us. You have always been a disagreeable burden, and I am only quit of a
      discomfort, and renounce forever the sight of you.&mdash;Give me your arm,
      my son, and accompany me at least to the threshold of your house, that you
      may be able to say to this cold-hearted viper, that she is forever rid of
      the sight of her mother, who will never think of her but with chilling
      contempt.&rdquo; She seized Ebenstreit by the arm, who had not the courage to
      resist her, and drew him along with her, casting a look of supreme disgust
      at old Trude, who stood pale and sad near the door.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV. BEHIND THE MASK.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As the door closed, and Marie found herself alone with her old friend and
      nurse, a peculiar change was visible in her sad face; something of its
      former sunny radiance brightened its usually sorrowful expression, and she
      turned to greet Trude with the smile of earlier, happier days, though it
      was tinged with sadness and grief. Impulsively she threw her arms around
      her faithful nurse, kissing her, and, with quivering lip, whispering: &ldquo;A
      greeting and a blessing for you, dear mother! Take me to your kind,
      disinterested heart, and let me there find repose from all this torture
      and love the poor lost one, who&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew suddenly back, her face assuming its usually cold, look as she
      heard her husband enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is gone, dear Marie. I hope that you are gratified with my decision,
      and perceive therein a proof of my excessive love and esteem for you,&rdquo;
       said Ebenstreit, drawing a long breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not desire this polite evidence of it,&rdquo; she coldly responded. &ldquo;We
      have solemnized our entrance into this house in a fitting manner, and the
      important matter remaining for us is to make known our arrival to the
      society of Berlin. The horses purchased in Alexandria, and the new
      carriage from London, have already arrived&mdash;have they not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My book-keeper so informed me a fortnight since, when we were in Paris,
      and complained of the enormous sum which he had to disburse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must forbid him such a liberty once for all,&rdquo; said she, and the
      strange blending of joy and scorn was visible in her face. &ldquo;It is
      inadmissible for a subordinate to presume to complain to his master, or
      advise him. He has only to listen and obey. This all your inferiors must
      understand, and know that they will be dismissed who murmur or advise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will instruct them accordingly,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;though I must confess my
      head-man well understands financial operations, and during the many years
      that he has been with me has won the right to be consulted and advised
      with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then prove your gratitude as it becomes a true cavalier and a nobleman,&rdquo;
       dictated Marie. &ldquo;Settle his salary as an annuity upon him, and replace
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he receives very great wages, and is still very active, though
      advanced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more the reason to pension him, that he may repose his remaining
      years and enjoy the fruit of his labors. But do as you like. I have only
      told you how a noble cavalier would act; if you choose to bargain and
      haggle, it is your own affair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heaven keep me from acting otherwise than as a nobleman!&rdquo; cried
      Ebenstreit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie nodded assent, desiring that the carriage might be ordered, with the
      Arab horses. &ldquo;We will make our visits at once, as I will, for the first
      time, open our large house for a soiree to-morrow evening,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is charming!&rdquo; said Ebenstreit, delighted. &ldquo;I shall at last have
      the opportunity of seeing the aristocratic Berlin society, and enter upon
      the rank of my new title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, with an expression of irrepressible scorn, &ldquo;you will
      have this enjoyment. Send me the steward, I wish to give him a list of the
      invited guests. You can add to it at your pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no one to invite,&rdquo; cried her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No matter! Make the necessary preparations. I will go to my room to make
      my toilet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you not allow me to accompany you? You are not yet familiar with the
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trude will show it to me, and you can at the same time give the orders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nodding proudly to Ebenstreit, she told Trude to precede her, following
      the old woman through the suite of brilliant rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is my lady&rsquo;s dressing-room,&rdquo; said Trude, entering one ornamented
      with mirrors, laces, and gauzes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French waiting-maid was busy within, unpacking the large trunks filled
      with silk and satin dresses which had been purchased by the dozens in
      Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lay out an elegant visiting toilet; I will return directly, after Trude
      has shown me the house,&rdquo; They entered the adjoining chamber, Marie&rsquo;s
      sleeping-room and found the German maid arranging the lace and silk
      coverings for her mistress to repose herself after the long journey. Marie
      betrayed no inclination for repose, but questioned Trude as to whither the
      other door led to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the little corridor, baroness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not order that there should be but one entrance to my
      sleeping-room, and that from the dressing-room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your commands have been strictly obeyed,&rdquo; replied Trude. &ldquo;The only door
      from the corridor leads to my two rooms, and there is but one entrance to
      them upon the other side, which can be securely fastened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Into the simple, quiet room, at the baroness&rsquo;s request, Trude opened the
      door, saying, &ldquo;Here we can be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie pointed silently to the second door, and the old woman nodded: &ldquo;That
      is it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I have done every thing as you directed. After you
      left, they sent me the furniture of your little garret-room, which I have
      arranged exactly as it stood there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Marie opened the door and found herself in the small room, so like the
      one where she had made flowers, given lessons, consoled by her only
      friend, Trude, her pride and reserve vanished. Sinking upon her knees, as
      if crushed, she gave way to her long-pent-up grief in one cry of anguish,
      clinging to Trude, and weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am, my faithful nurse, returned to you more wretched and miserable
      than when I left: then, I felt that I could scorn the world, and now I
      despise myself. Oh, Trude, they have caused my wretchedness, they have
      made me selfish and unkind. I was contented until now, and rejoiced in my
      misery, and triumphantly thought of the time when I was wont to bewail my
      broken heart and lost soul. Once more with you, and surrounded with the
      souvenirs of my girlhood, I feel a horror of myself, and could sink in
      shame and contrition. I have become as bad as they are. Can you forgive
      the hard-hearted daughter who banished her own mother from her house? I
      felt that I could not endure her presence, and feared that an inveterate
      rancor and hate would overpower me, and that I should curse her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She deserves it, my poor child,&rdquo; whispered Trude, the tears streaming
      down her cheeks. &ldquo;She has just told you that she never loved you, and in
      this painful scene she thought only of bargaining and making money. God
      has heard her and forgiven you as I do, and I beg and implore Him to
      punish those who have made you so wretched, and that He will have no mercy
      upon them, as they have shown none to you. It breaks my heart to see you
      so changed, and I can hardly believe this cold, haughty lady is my Marie.
      In your tears I recognize you, and I bless God that you can weep; your
      grief proves to me that you are yet the child of my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Trude, you know not how I have longed to see you; it was my only
      consolation in these painful years. When I doubted every human being, then
      I thought of you, and was comforted and sustained.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And was there no one else to think of, my child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she gently murmured, &ldquo;I thought of him. Tell me all you know about
      him, and hide nothing from me in this hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you would ask me, and I went to Director Gedicke yesterday, to
      inform myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you hear? Tell me the most important. Does he live? Is he
      restored to health?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He lives, but, for one year, he was so wretched that he could not teach;
      now he is better. Herr Gedicke went himself to Spandau, immediately after
      the wedding, and brought him back with him, relating as forbearingly and
      carefully as possible the circumstances of your marriage, and of your
      sacrificing yourself for him alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he receive it? What did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. His eyes were fixed, and his lips uttered not a sound. This
      lasted for weeks, and suddenly he became excited, enraged, and they were
      obliged to bind him to keep him from injuring himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me no more,&rdquo; cried Marie, shuddering. &ldquo;I thought myself stronger,
      nay, heartless, and yet it seems as if a hand of iron were tearing,
      rending my soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; said Trude, gently; &ldquo;you must awaken from this hardened
      indifference; giving way to your grief in tears will soften your heart,
      and it will again be penetrated with the love of God and mankind. I will
      tell you every thing; you ought to know how poor, dear Moritz suffered.
      After he vented his rage he became melancholy, and withdrew to Halle in
      solitude, living in a hay-loft. His favorite books and an old piano were
      his only companions; no one presumed to intrude him, and they even
      conveyed his food secretly to him, shoving it through a door. He talked
      aloud to himself for hours long, and at night sang so touchingly,
      accompanying himself upon the piano, that those who listened wept.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie wept also&mdash;scalding tears trickled through her fingers as she
      lay upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trude continued: &ldquo;Moritz lived in this way one year; his friends knew how
      he was suffering, and they proved in their deeds how much they loved and
      esteemed him. The teachers at the Gymnasium divided his hours of
      instruction among them, that he should not forfeit his place and lose his
      salary. Even the king showed great sympathy for him, sending to inquire
      for him. Herr Gedicke visited him frequently at Halle; and once when about
      to mount the ladder to the hay-loft he met Moritz descending, carefully
      dressed, in a reasonable, gentle mood, and then he returned with him to
      Berlin. There was great rejoicing in the college over his return, and they
      feted him, witnessing so much love for him that it was really touching. He
      has been promoted to professor, and at the express command of the king he
      teaches the young Prince Frederick William in Latin and Greek. Oh, he is
      so much esteemed and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is married I hope,&rdquo; murmured Marie. &ldquo;Is he not happily married,
      Trude?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Herr Gedicke says he could marry a wealthy girl, for he is a great
      favorite, and is invited into the most distinguished society. He repels
      every one, and has become a woman-hater.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hates them&mdash;does that mean that he hates me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he thoroughly scorns and despises you; so much so that Herr Gedicke
      says you should know of it, and keep out of his way. He has sworn to
      publicly show his contempt for you, and therefore his friends wish you to
      be apprised of it, and not encounter him in society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is well, I thank you,&rdquo; said Marie, rising; &ldquo;I will act accordingly.
      Kiss me once more, my dear mother, and let me repose my weary head upon
      your bosom. Ah, Trude, what a sorrow life is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will yet learn to love it again, Marie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought that I could sink so low, I would kill myself this very
      hour. I know myself better, and only for revenge do I live. Hush! say
      nothing more. Look at me! I am cursed, and there in those gaudy rooms in
      my purgatory; here is my paradise, and here the wicked demon may dare to
      change into the sad, wretched wife, who mourns the happy days already
      flown, and weeps the inconsolable future. Oft will I come here in the
      night when those sleep who think me so proud and happy, and you alone
      shall behold me as I am. Now I must back to purgatory.&mdash;Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A half hour later a splendid carriage drove from the house of Herr
      Ebenstreit von Leuthen. The people upon the street stood in wondering
      admiration of the beautiful Arab horses with the costly silver-mounted
      harness, and sought to catch a glimpse of the occupants of the carriage,
      an insignificant, meagre, blond-haired man, who appeared like a servant
      beside the lovely pale wife, though proud and indifferent, who kept her
      eyes fixed steadily before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chasseur, with his waving plumes, sat upon the box beside the
      rich-liveried coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the married couple returned from their drive, having left their cards
      at the most distinguished houses in Berlin, the baroness handed the list
      of guests to be invited to the baron to examine. He glanced hastily over
      it, assuring her that every thing should be directed as she desired,
      deferring all to her superior knowledge. Suddenly he seemed confused, even
      frightened. &ldquo;What is the matter? What were you about to remark?&rdquo; asked
      Marie, indifferently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was in error. I have, without doubt, read it wrong. I beg pardon for a
      foolish blunder, but will you tell me this name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie bent forward to look at the paper which her husband handed her, and,
      pointing with her finger, read &ldquo;Professor Philip Moritz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you intend to invite him?&rdquo; asked Ebenstreit, quite alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not? He belongs to the circle of friends and acquaintances,
      and it is natural that I should include him. Moreover, there is not a
      little gossip, and it is necessary to silence it. If you are not of my
      opinion, strike out the name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, dearest. On the contrary, you are perfectly right, and I
      admire you for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then give the list to the butler, for it is quite time that the
      invitations were given out.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV. THE CURSE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The evening of the soiree had arrived. In quick succession drove the
      carriages up the broad entrance to the mansion of Herr Ebenstreit, The
      curious street public pressed in compact masses near the gate to peep in,
      or at least catch a fugitive glance of the ladies alighting from their
      carriages, who were received by the butler at the foot of the carpeted
      steps. A host of gold-bespangled footmen lined the entrance upon each
      side, which was ornamented with the most exquisite hot-house plants,
      filling the air with perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two tall, stately footmen, with broad gold shoulder-bands and large gilt
      batons, stood at the door of the anteroom, which was brilliantly
      illuminated with chandeliers and side-lights, reflected in the numerous
      mirrors. The anteroom led into the reception-room by wide folding-doors,
      where the names were given to the usher, who announced them in a
      stentorian voice in the drawing-room. There stood the Baron von Ebenstreit
      to receive the guests, all smiles, and with bustling assiduity accompany
      them to the adjoining drawing-room to present them to the baroness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the select company were conspicuous the most distinguished names of
      the aristocracy. Generals and staff-officers, countesses and baronesses
      were crowded together, with the ladies of the financial world, near
      ministers and counsellors in this gorgeous saloon, which was the delight
      and admiration of the envious, and excited the tongues of the slanderous.
      Those acquainted gathered in the window-niches and cosy corners,
      maliciously criticising the motley crowd, and eminently consoled with the
      sure prospect of the ruin of the late banker, surrounding himself with
      such unbecoming splendor and luxury, the bad taste of his arrogant,
      overdressed, and extravagant wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you noticed her parure of diamonds?&rdquo; whispered the Countess Moltke
      to Fran von Morien. &ldquo;If they are real, then she wears an estate upon her
      shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The family estate of Von Leuthen,&rdquo; laughingly replied Frau von Morien.
      &ldquo;You know, I suppose, that the father of General von Leuthen was a
      brick-burner, and he may have succeeded in changing a few bricks into
      diamonds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are wicked, sweet one,&rdquo; replied the countess, smiling. &ldquo;One must
      acknowledge that her toilet is charming. I have never seen its equal. The
      gold lace over the rose-colored satin is superb.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and the mingling of straw feathers, diamonds, flowers, lace, and
      birds is truly ridiculous in her head-dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must have been copied exactly from the one which the Queen Marie
      Antoinette wore at the ball at Versailles a fortnight since. The baroness
      was present at this court ball with her greyhound of a husband, and
      created quite a sensation with her costly recherchee toilet, as the French
      ambassador told us yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not by her manner,&rdquo; said Frau von Morien. &ldquo;She is insupportably
      arrogant and self-sufficient. What do you think of this pretentious manner
      of announcing our names as if we were at an auction where they sold
      titles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very good French custom,&rdquo; remarked the countess. &ldquo;But it does not
      become a lady of doubtful nobility and uncertain position, to introduce
      foreign customs here. She should leave this to others, and modestly accept
      those already in use by us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One remarks the puffed-up parvenue,&rdquo; whispered Frau von Morien. &ldquo;Every
      thing smells of the varnish upon the newly-painted coat-of-arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, my friend! I there comes the baroness leaning upon the arm of the
      French ambassador. She is indeed imposing in appearance, and one could
      mistake her for a queen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could any one ever suppose that this queen once made flowers to sell?
      Come, countess, I have just thought of a charming scene to revenge myself
      upon this arrogant personage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Giving her arm to the countess, she approached her hostess leaning upon
      the arm of the Marquis de Treves, the French ambassador, as they were
      standing beneath the immense chandelier of rock crystal, which sparkled
      above them like a crown of stars, causing her diamonds to look as if in
      one blaze of different hues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, permit us to sun ourselves in your rays, ma toute belle,&rdquo; said the
      Countess Moltke. &ldquo;One could well fancy themselves in a fairy palace, so
      enchanting is everything here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the baroness&rsquo;s appearance confirms this impression,&rdquo; remarked the
      gallant Frenchman. &ldquo;Fancy could not well paint a more lovely fairy in
      one&rsquo;s happiest dreams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, truly I wander around as if in an enchanted scene. I feel as if I
      must seize myself by the head and be well shaken, to convince myself that
      I am really awake and not dreaming a chapter from Aladdin. I made the
      effort, but felt the wreath of roses in my hair, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that convinced you of your wakefulness,&rdquo; said the baroness, a little
      haughtily. Turning to the ambassador, she added: &ldquo;Do you observe, monsieur
      le marquis, what a delicate attention this lady shows me in wearing a
      wreath of flowers which I manufactured?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Comment! The baroness is truly a fairy! She causes flowers to grow at her
      pleasure, and vies with Nature. It seems impossible. I can scarcely
      believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet it is true,&rdquo; said Frau von Morien. &ldquo;The baroness, indeed,
      fabricated these roses three years since, when she had the kindness to
      work for me. You will acknowledge that I have kept them well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was no kindness of mine, but a necessity,&rdquo; said the baroness, &ldquo;and I
      must confess that I would not have undertaken so troublesome a piece of
      work from pure goodness or pleasure. You will remember that I was very
      poor before my marriage, and as Frau von Morien was one of my customers,
      it is very natural that she possesses my flowers. She gave me many orders,
      and paid me a very small price, for she is very practical and prudent, and
      understands bargaining and cheapening, and when one is poor they are
      obliged to yield to the shameless parsimony of the rich. I thank you, my
      dear benefactress, for the honor you have shown me in wearing my flowers,
      for it has been a pleasant occasion to explain ourselves and recognize
      each other. Have the kindness to recall other remembrances of the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not remember possessing any other souvenirs,&rdquo; replied the countess,
      confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you forgotten that I gave French lessons to your niece, the present
      Frau von Hohenthal? She came to me three times weekly, because the lessons
      were a few groschen cheaper at the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the usher announced in a loud voice, &ldquo;Professor Philip
      Moritz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gentleman of slight proportions, in an elegant fashionable dress,
      appeared and remained standing in the doorway, his large black eyes
      wandering searchingly through the drawing-room. Herr von Ebenstreit
      approached, extending him his hand, uttering a few unintelligible words,
      which his guest appeared not to notice, but, slightly inclining, asked if
      he would present him to the lady of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the kindness to follow me,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit, leading Moritz through
      the circle of jesting, slandering ladies and gentlemen, to the centre of
      the room, where Marie was still standing with the French ambassador and
      the two ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;I have brought you an old acquaintance,
      Professor Moritz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Ebenstreit would retreat, Moritz commanded him to remain, placing his
      white-gloved hand upon his arm, and holding him fast. &ldquo;I would ask you one
      question before I speak with the baroness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moritz spoke so loud, and in such a strange, harsh, and repulsive manner,
      that every one turned astonished, asking himself what it meant.
      Conversation was hushed, and the curious pressed toward the peculiar group
      in the centre to the baroness, who regarded her husband perfectly
      composed, and the pale man, with the flashing eyes, the glance of which
      pierced her like daggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A breathless silence reigned, broken only by Ebenstreit&rsquo;s trembling voice.
      &ldquo;What is it, professor? How can I serve you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me who you are?&rdquo; replied Moritz, with a gruff laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am the Baron Ebenstreit von Leuthen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the scar which you bear upon your face, is it not the mark of a whip,
      with which I lashed a certain Herr Ebenstreit three years since, who
      prevented my eloping with my betrothed? I challenged him to fight a duel,
      but the coward refused me satisfaction, and then I struck him in the face,
      causing the blood to flow. Answer me&mdash;are you this gentleman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Not a sound interrupted the fearfully long pause which followed. Every one
      turned astonished to Ebenstreit, who, pale as death, was powerless to
      utter a word, but stood staring at his opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you not answer me?&rdquo; cried Moritz, stamping his foot. &ldquo;Are you the
      coward? Was this red scar caused by the whip-lash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another long pause ensued, and a distinctly audible voice was heard,
      saying, &ldquo;Yes, it is he!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who replied to me?&rdquo; asked Moritz, turning his angry glance away from
      Ebenstreit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Marie. &ldquo;I reply for my husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? Are you the wife of this man?&rdquo; thundered Moritz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Marie answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this invitation directed to me from you?&rdquo; he continued, drawing a
      paper from his pocket. &ldquo;Did you permit yourself to invite me to your
      house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; she calmly answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And by what right, madame? This is the question I wish answered, and I
      came here for that purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I invited you because I desired to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shameless one!&rdquo; cried Moritz, furious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried the ambassador, placing himself before Moritz, defying his
      anger, &ldquo;you forget that you are speaking to a lady. As her husband is
      silent, I declare myself her knight, and I will not suffer her to be
      injured by word or look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you hinder me?&rdquo; cried Moritz, with scorn. &ldquo;What will you do if I
      dash this paper at her feet, and forbid her to ever write my name again?&rdquo;
       Making a ball of it, he suited the action to the word, casting a defiant
      look at the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall order the footmen to thrust you out of the house. Here, servants,
      remove this man; he is an escaped lunatic, undoubtedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two footmen pressed forward through the circle which crowded around
      Moritz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whoever touches me, death to him!&rdquo; thundered Moritz, laying his hand upon
      a small sword at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let no one dare lay a hand on this gentleman,&rdquo; cried Marie, with a
      commanding wave of her hand to the lackeys. &ldquo;I beseech you, marquis, and
      you, honored guests, to quietly await the conclusion of this scene, and to
      permit Herr Moritz to finish speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to defy me, madame?&rdquo; muttered Moritz, gnashing his teeth.
      &ldquo;You perhaps count upon my magnanimity to keep silent, and not disclose
      the secrets of the past to this aristocratic assembly. I stand here as its
      accusing spirit, and condemn you as a shameless perjurer.&mdash;I will ask
      you who are here rendering homage to this woman, if you know who she is,
      and of what she has been guilty? As a young girl she was as sweet and
      innocent as an angel, and seemed more like a divine revelation. To think
      of her, inspired and elevated one&rsquo;s thoughts, and heaven was mirrored in
      her eyes. She was poor, and yet so infinitely rich, that if a king had
      laid all his treasures at her feet, as the gift of his love, he would
      receive more than he gave, for in her heart reposed the wealth of the
      whole human race. Oh! I could weep tears of blood in reflecting upon what
      she was, and what she has become. Smile and mock, ladies and gentlemen; my
      brain is crazed, and I weep for my lost angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Moritz dashed his hands to his face, and stood swaying backward and
      forward, sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sighs and regrets were heard in the room. The ladies pressed their
      handkerchiefs to their eyes; others regarded with lively sympathy the
      handsome young man, who deeply interested them, and gazed reproachfully at
      the young baroness, expecting her to be crushed with these reproaches and
      tears, but who, on the contrary, stood with proud composure, her face
      beaming with joy, gazing at Moritz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is past&mdash;my last tear is shed, and my last wail has been
      uttered,&rdquo; cried Philip, uncovering his face. &ldquo;My angel has changed into a
      despicable woman. I loved her as the wretched, disconsolate being adores
      the one who reveals paradise to him; and she fooled me into the belief
      that she loved me. We exchanged vows of eternal constancy and affection,
      and promised each other to bear joyfully every ill in life, and never
      separate until death. I should have doubted myself, rather than she who
      stood above me, like a divine revelation. I wished to win her by toil and
      industry, by my intellect, and the fame by which I could render my name
      illustrious. It was, indeed, nothing in the eyes of her grasping parents;
      they repulsed me with scorn and pride, but Marie encouraged me to perfect
      confidence in her affection. Whilst I wandered on foot to Silesia, like a
      poor pilgrim toward happiness, to humble myself before the king, to beg
      and combat for my angel, there came temptation, sin, and vulgarity, in the
      form of this pale, cowed-down man, who stands beside my betrothed gasping
      with rage. The temptation of riches changed my angel into a demon, a
      miserable woman bartered for gold! She betrayed her love, yielding it up
      for filthy lucre, crushing her nobler nature in the dust, and driving over
      it, as did Tullia the dead body of her father. She sold herself for
      riches, before which you all kneel, as if worshipping the golden calf!
      After selling her soul to a man whom she despised, even if he were not
      rich, she has had the boldness to summon me, the down-trodden and
      half-crazed victim, to her gilded palace, as if I were a slave to be
      attached to her triumphal car. I am a free man, and have come here only to
      hurl contempt in her face, to brand her before you all as a perjurer and a
      traitress, whom I never will pardon, but will curse with my latest breath!
      Now I have relieved my heart of its burden, I command this woman to deny
      what I have said, if she can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a dictatorial wave of the hand, he pointed excitedly Marie. A
      deathlike stillness reigned. Even the lights seemed to grow dim, and every
      one was oppressed as if by excessive sultriness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Moritz commanded Marie to acknowledge the truth of his accusations
      before the honored assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She encountered his angry glance with calmness, and a smile was
      perceptible upon her lip. &ldquo;Yes, said she, I acknowledge that I am a
      perjurer and a traitor. I have sold myself for riches, and yielded my
      peace of soul and my love for mammon. I might justify myself, but I
      refrain from it, and will only say that you have told the truth! One day
      you will cease to curse me, and, perhaps a tear of pity will glisten in
      the eye now flashing with scorn and anger. The poor wife who lies in the
      dust implores for the last blessing of your love!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie!&rdquo; he cried, with heart-rending anguish, &ldquo;oh, Marie!&rdquo; and rushed
      toward her, kneeling before her, and clinging to her, pressing a kiss upon
      her hand and weeping aloud. Only for a moment did he give way, and then
      sprang up wildly, rushing through the crowd, out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fearful silence ensued. No one had the courage to break it. Every one
      hoped that Marie, through a simulated fainting, would end the painful
      scene, and give the guests an opportunity to withdraw. No such
      thoughtfulness for her friends occurred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to the Marquis de Treves, who stood pale and deeply agitated
      behind her, and burst into a loud laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pale you are! Have you taken this comedy for truth? Did you think
      this theatrical performance was a reality? You have forgotten what I told
      you a month since in Paris, that I had a native talent for acting. You
      would contest the matter with me, and I bet you that I could introduce an
      impromptu scene in my house, with such artistic skill, that you would be
      quite deceived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do recall it; how could I have forgotten it?&rdquo; replied the
      marquis, with the ready tact of the diplomat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I won?&rdquo; asked Marie, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have played your role, baroness, like an artiste of consummate
      talent, and to-morrow I shall have the honor to cancel the debt in your
      favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, give me your arm, marquis, and conduct me to the dancing-room,
      and you, worthy guests, follow us,&rdquo; said. Marie, leading the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merry music even was not sufficient to dissipate the awkward
      oppression, and by midnight the guests had taken leave, and Marie stood
      under the chandelier, pale and rigid, opposite her husband. He had
      summoned courage to bewail the terrible scene, weeping and mourning over
      her cruelty and his shame. Marie, with chilling indifference, regarded him
      without one visible trace of pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You realized what you were doing when you imposed the scorn of this
      marriage upon me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have never deceived you with vain hopes!
      You have sown dragons&rsquo; teeth, and warriors have sprung up to revenge me
      upon you. Serve yourself of your riches to fight the combatants. See if
      you can bargain for a quiet conscience as easily as you purchased me! My
      soul is free though, and it hovers over you as the spirit of revenge.&mdash;Beware!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slowly turned and quitted the room. Her diamonds sparkled and blazed
      in the myriads of lights. The large mirrors reflected the image of a
      haughty woman, who swept proudly past like a goddess of revenge!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit stood gazing after her. He had a horror of the lonely still
      room, so gorgeous and brilliantly illuminated&mdash;a shudder crept over
      him, and he sank, weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the little room, the buried happiness of the past, Marie knelt, with
      outstretched arms, imploring heaven for mercy. &ldquo;I thank Thee, Heavenly
      Father, that I have been permitted to see him again! My sacrifice was not
      in vain&mdash;he lives! He is free, and his mind is clear and bright. I
      thank Thee that he still loves me. His anger is but love!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVI. THE KING AND THE ROSICRUCIANS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The joy which Bischofswerder said, reigned in heaven and upon earth over
      the return of the crown prince to the path of virtue, in having forsaken
      Wilhelmine Enke, was of but short duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Invisibles and the pious Rosicrucians soon learned that sagacious and
      cunning woman defied the spirits and abjured the oaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the night of his communion with the departed, Frederick William had
      never visited Charlottenburg&mdash;never seen the house which contained
      all that he held most dear; he had returned Wilhelmine&rsquo;s letters unopened,
      and had even had the courage to refuse himself to the children, who came
      to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had been left to consult his own heart, he would not probably have
      had sufficient resolution to have done this; Bischofswerder and Woellner
      never left him for a moment, as they said the Invisible Fathers had
      commanded them to tarry with the much-loved brother in these first days of
      trial and temptation, and to elevate and gladden him with edifying
      conversations and scientific investigations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prayers and exhortations were the duty of Woellner, who, besides this,
      continued his daily discourses upon the administration of government,
      preparing the prince for the important command of the royal regiments,
      which they hoped favorable destiny would soon grant him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scientific researches were the part of Bischofswerder, and he entered
      upon his duties with the zeal and pleasure of an inquiring mind, itself
      hopeful and believing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cabinet arranged in the new palace at Potsdam, the prince and his
      dear Bischofswerder worked daily, many hours, to discover the great hope
      of the alchemist&mdash;the philosopher&rsquo;s stone. Not finding it,
      unfortunately, they brewed all sorts of miraculous drinks, which were
      welcome to the prince as the elixir of eternal youth and constant love. In
      the evenings they communed with the spirits of the distinguished departed,
      which, moved at the earnest prayers of Woellner, and the fervent
      exhortation of the crown prince, always had the goodness to appear, and
      witness their satisfaction for their much-loved son, as they called him,
      for continuing brave and faithful, and not falling into the unholy snares
      of the seductress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crown prince, however, experienced not the least self-contentment.
      Each day renewed the yearning for the beloved of his youth and for his
      children, for which those of his wife were no compensation&mdash;neither
      the silent, awkward Prince Frederick William, nor his crying little
      brother. In his dreams he saw Wilhelmine dissolved in tears, calling upon
      him in most tender accents, and when he awoke, it was to an inconsolable
      grief. He wept with heart-felt sorrow; his oath alone kept him from
      hastening to her; it bound him, and fettered his earnest wish to see her,
      making him sad and melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirits had no pity nor mercy upon him. His two confidants encouraged
      his virtue and piety from morning till night, exalting his excited fancy
      with their marvellous relations and apparitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day as they were on the point of commencing the morning prayers to the
      Invisibles, a royal footman appeared, with the command to betake
      themselves to Sans-Souci, where the king awaited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A royal carriage was in attendance to convey them. There was no
      alternative but obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Fate destines us to become martyrs to the holy cause,&rdquo; said
      Woellner, devoutly folding his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We may never enjoy the happiness of seeing our dear brothers of the
      confederacy again,&rdquo; sighed Bischofswerder. &ldquo;Our spirits will always be
      with you, my prince, and the Invisible Fathers will protect you in all
      your ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crown prince, deeply moved, separated from his friends with tears in
      his eyes; but as the carriage rolled away he felt relieved as of an
      oppressive burden, and breathed more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time a footman entered, bearing upon a golden salver a letter
      for the prince. Unobserved and free to act, he read it, and as he sat
      musingly thinking over its contents, so tender and affectionate, he
      re-read it, and rising, made a bold resolve, his face beaming with
      happiness, to order his carriage, which he did, and in a few moments more
      drove at full speed away from the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bischofswerder and Woellner, in the mean time, arrived at Sans-Souci. The
      footman awaiting them conducted them at once through the picture-gallery,
      into the little corridor leading to the king&rsquo;s cabinet, and there left
      them to announce them to his majesty. Both gentlemen heard their names
      called in a loud voice, and the response of the king: &ldquo;Let them wait in
      the little corridor until I permit them to enter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The footman returned and with subdued voice made known the royal command,
      and departed, carefully closing the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no seat in the narrow, little corridor, and the air was close
      and oppressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      They could hear voices in mingled conversation; sometimes it seemed as if
      the king were communicating commands; again, as if he dictated in a
      suppressed voice. The Rosicrucians knew very well it was the hour of the
      cabinet council, and they waited patiently and steadfastly, but as their
      watches revealed the fact that three hours had passed, and every noise was
      hushed, they concluded they were forgotten, and resolved to remind the
      lackey of their presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, this standing is quite insupportable,&rdquo; whispered Woellner.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both slipped to the entrance and tried the bronze knob, but although
      it turned, the door opened not, and was evidently fastened upon the
      outside. They looked alarmed at each other, asking what it could mean.
      &ldquo;Can it be intentional? Are we imprisoned here? We must be resigned,
      although it is a severe experience.&rdquo; At last, patience exhausted, they
      resolved to bear it no longer, and tapped gently at the door of the king.
      The loud bark of a dog was their only response, and again all was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evidently there is no one there,&rdquo; sighed Bischofswerder. &ldquo;It is the hour
      of dining of the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish it were ours also,&rdquo; whined Woellner. &ldquo;I confess I yearn for bodily
      nourishment, and my legs sink under me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am fearfully hungry,&rdquo; groaned Bischofswerder; &ldquo;besides, the air is
      suffocating. I am resolved to go to extremes, and make a noise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rushed like a caged boar from one door to the other, shrieking for the
      lackey to open the door; but as before, a loud bark was the only response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord has forsaken us,&rdquo; whimpered Woellner. &ldquo;The sublime Fathers have
      turned their faces away from us. We will pray for mercy and beg for a
      release!&rdquo; and he sank upon his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will that avail us here, where neither prayers nor devotion are
      heeded? Only energy and determination will aid us at Sans-Souci. Come, let
      us thump and bang until they set us free!&rdquo; cried Bischofswerder,
      peevishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their hands were lame, and their voices hoarse with their exertions; and
      no longer able to stand, they sank down upon the floor hungry and
      exhausted, almost weeping with rage and despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after long hours of misery, they heard a noise in the adjoining
      room. The king had again entered his cabinet. The door opened, and the
      lackey motioned to the two gentlemen to enter. They rose with difficulty
      and staggered into the room, the door being closed behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      His majesty was seated in his arm-chair, with his three-cornered hat on,
      leaning his chin upon his hands, crossed upon his staff. He fixed his
      great blue eyes, with a searching glance, upon the two Rosicrucians; then
      turned to his minister, Herzberg, who was seated at the table covered with
      documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These are, then, the two great props of the Rosicrucians?&rdquo; asked
      Frederick&mdash;&ldquo;the two charlatans whom they have told me make hell hot
      for the crown prince, continually lighting it up with their prayers and
      litanies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty,&rdquo; answered Herzberg, smiling, &ldquo;these gentlemen are Colonel
      Bischofswerder and the councillor of the exchequer, Woellner, whom your
      majesty has commanded to appear before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the two gentlemen who work miracles, and have the effrontery to
      summon the spirit of our ancestor, the great elector, and the Emperor
      Marcus Aurelius?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; stammered Bischofswerder, &ldquo;we have tried to summon spirits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I too,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;only they will not come; therefore I wished
      to see the enchanters, and would like to purchase the secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, most gracious sire,&rdquo; said Woellner, humbly, &ldquo;you must first be
      received in the holy order of the Rosicrucians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;I am not ready for the like follies, and whilst
      I live the Invisibles must take heed not to become too visible, or they
      will be taken care of. I will not permit Prussia to retrograde. It has
      cost too much trouble to enlighten the people, bring them to reason, and
      banish hypocrisy. Say to the Rosicrucians that they shall leave the crown
      prince in peace, or I will chase them to the devil, who will receive them
      with open arms! It could do no harm to appeal to the prince&rsquo;s conscience
      to lead an honorable life, and direct his thoughts more to study than to
      love, but you shall not make a hypocrite of him and misuse his natural
      good-nature. If the Rosicrucians try to force the prince and rule him, I
      will show them that I am master, and will no longer suffer their
      absurdities, but will break up the whole nest of them! I have been much,
      annoyed at the deep despondency of the crown prince. You shall not
      represent to him that baseness and virtue are the same, and that he is the
      latter when he betrays those to whom he has sworn fidelity and affection.
      An honorable man must, above all, he cognizant of benefits, and not
      forsake those who have sacrificed their honor and love to him, and have
      proved their fidelity. Have you understood me, gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be my holy duty to follow strictly your majesty&rsquo;s commands,&rdquo; said
      Bischofswerder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also will strive to promote the will of my king,&rdquo; asserted
      Woellner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be necessary to do so, or you two gentlemen may find yourselves
      at Spandau. I would say to you once for all, I will not suffer any sects;
      every one can worship God in his own way. No one shall have the arrogant
      presumption to declare himself one of the elect. We are all sinners. The
      Rosicrucians are not better than the Illuminati or Freemasons, and none
      are more worthy than the tailor and cobbler who does his duty. Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king nodded quickly and pointed to the door out of which the two
      brothers were about to disappear, when he called them back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the prince is not at the palace on your return, I advise you not to
      pursue him, but reflect that the Invisibles may have summoned him to a
      communion of spirits; I believe, too, that I kept you waiting; but without
      doubt you were comforted by the Fathers, who bore you away upon their
      wings, and gave you food and drink! Those who are protected by the
      spirits, and can summon them at pleasure, can never want. If you are
      hungry, call up the departed Lucullus, that he may provide for you to eat;
      and if you have no earthly seat, summon Semiramis that she may send you
      her hanging gardens for the quiet repose of the elect! I am rejoiced that
      you have enjoyed such celestial refreshments in the corridor. Adieu!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The king gazed sadly after them. Approaching Herzberg, he said: &ldquo;I felt,
      as I looked at the two rogues, that it was a pity to grow old. Did you
      think that I would let them off so easily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, I really do not understand you,&rdquo; replied Herzberg, shrugging his
      shoulders. &ldquo;I know not, in your most active youthful days, how you could
      have done otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you that, if I were not an old man, void of decision and
      energy, I would have had these fellows taken to Spandau for life!&rdquo; said
      the king, striking the table with his staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your majesty does yourself injustice,&rdquo; said Herzberg, smiling. &ldquo;You were
      ever a just monarch in your most ardent youth, and never set aside the
      law. These men were not guilty of any positive crime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are daily and hourly guilty of enticing away from me the crown
      prince, and making the future ruler of my country an obscurer, a
      necromancer, and at the same time a libertine! I was obliged to overlook
      his youthful preference for Wilhelmine Enke, and wink at this amour, for I
      know that crown prince is human, and his affections are to be consulted.
      If he cannot love the wife which diplomacy chooses for him, then he must
      be permitted the chosen one of his heart to console him for the forced
      marriage. At the same time this person was passable, and without the usual
      fault of such creatures, a desire to rule and mingle in politics. She
      seems to be unambitious and unpretentious. These Rosicrucians would banish
      her by increasing the number of favorites, that they may rule him, and
      make the future King of Prussia a complete tool in their hands. They
      excite his mind, which is not too well balanced, and rob him by their
      witchcraft of the intellect that he has. They promise him to find the
      philosopher&rsquo;s stone, and make a fool of him. Am I not right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must acknowledge that you are,&rdquo; sighed Herzberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And admit also that it would be just to send these in, famous fellows as
      criminals to Spandau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sire, unfortunately, there are crimes and offences which the law does not
      reach, and which cannot be judged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I was young,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;I tore up and stamped upon every weed
      that I found in my garden. Shall I now let these two grow and infect the
      air, because the law gives me no right to crush them? Formerly I would
      have torn them leaf from leaf, but now I am old and useless, my hand is
      weak, and lacks the strength to uproot them, therefore I suffer them to
      stand, and all the other abominable things which these rogues bring to
      pass. A cloud is rising, from which a storm will one day burst over
      Prussia; but I cannot dissipate it, for the little strength and breath
      that remains I have need of for the government; and, moreover, I have no
      superfluous time for the future, but must live and work only for the
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the blessing of your exertions will be felt in the future. The deeds
      of a great man are not extinguished with his death, but shine like a star,
      disseminating light beyond his grave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This light is just what the Rosicrucians will take care to extinguish
      like a tallow candle with too long a wick, and it is good fortune that the
      astronomers have awarded me a little glorification in the heavens, and
      accorded me a star, for the Rosicrucians would not let it shine here
      below. I must console myself with this, and recall that when it is dark
      and lowering here, I have a star above in the sky!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This star is Frederick&rsquo;s honor,&rdquo; cried Herzberg. &ldquo;It will beam upon
      future generations, and become the guiding light of the sons and nephews
      of your house, and they will learn to be as sagacious and wise as the
      Great Frederick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have made a great error, Herzberg,&rdquo; replied the king, quickly.
      &ldquo;Future generations are newer taught by the past&mdash;grandchildren think
      themselves wiser than their grandparents. The greatest of heroes is
      forgotten, and his deeds buried in the dust of ages. You have given me a
      glorious title of honor, and I know how little I deserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A title which will be confirmed in centuries to come, for every history
      will speak of Frederick the Second as Frederick Great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In history it may be, but the people will speak of me as &lsquo;Old Fritz&rsquo;&mdash;that
      will be on the lips of those who love me, and expression of endearment; on
      the lips of those who hate me, one of disaffection. I am, indeed, &lsquo;Old
      Fritz,&rsquo; which the Bischofswerders and Woellners also call me, and try to
      make the crown prince believe that I have outlived my period, and do not
      understand or esteem the modern time. In their eyes I am a dismantled ship
      of state, which the storms of life have rendered unseaworthy. They would
      refit the vessel, and give it a new flag, sending Old Fritz, the helmsman,
      to the devil! The day of my death they will hoist this flag, with &lsquo;Modern
      Time&rsquo; inscribed upon it in large letters. I shall then be united in
      Elysium with Voltaire, Jordan, Suhm, and all my other friends, as we were
      wont to be at Sans-Souci, and look down with a pitying smile upon the
      Modern Time and Old Folly!&mdash;Vale!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII. THE ESPOUSALS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Both Bischofswerder and Woellner hastened to avail themselves of the
      commanding &ldquo;adieu,&rdquo; and quit the royal presence. Without, the carriage was
      ready to reconvey them to the new palace. They were so exhausted that
      neither of them uttered a word, the last injunctions of the king ringing
      in their ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silently they alighted upon arriving, but as the footman came out to meet
      them they asked, simultaneously, if his royal highness had dined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His highness is not here, having departed immediately after the two
      gentlemen, and is not yet returned,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may serve us something to eat as quickly as possible in the little
      dining-room. Let it be ready in a quarter of an hour,&rdquo; commanded
      Bischofswerder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that we are alone, what do you think of this affair?&rdquo; asked Woellner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot vouchsafe a reply until I have eaten a pheasant&rsquo;s wing, and
      drunken my champagne,&rdquo; replied Bischofswerder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept his word, preserving a solemn silence until a good half of the
      bird had disappeared, and many glasses of iced champagne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bischofswerder leaned back in his comfortable armchair with infinite
      ease, whilst his friend occupied himself with the most pious zeal with the
      pheasant, rejoicing at this revelation of the Invisibles. Bischofswerder
      let him enjoy it, and ordered the footman to serve the dessert and
      withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I am prepared to reply to you, my dear friend, that we are alone. I
      believe the king would have sent us to Spandau at once if we had opposed
      his free-thinking opinions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am convinced of it,&rdquo; sighed Woellner, eyeing the remains of the bird
      with a melancholy glance. &ldquo;We shall have much to endure for the holy cause
      which we serve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, we will have much to suffer if we, in fanatical
      indiscretion, do not submit to circumstances,&rdquo; said Bischofswerder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot traduce the sublime Fathers!&rdquo; cried Woellner;&mdash;&ldquo;for the
      body&rsquo;s security, we cannot endanger the salvation of our souls, and, like
      Peter, deny our master.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my much-loved and noble friend. But we must be wise as serpents, and
      our duty to the holy order is to preserve its useful tools that they may
      not be lost. You will agree with me in this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I do admit it,&rdquo; replied Wollner, pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Further, you will acknowledge that we are very useful, and I might say
      indispensable tools of the Sublime Order of the Rosicrucians and the
      Invisible Fathers of the Order of Jesus? It is our task to secure an
      abiding-place to the proscribed and, cursed, to plough and sow the field,
      which will yield good fruit for humanity entire, and particularly our
      order, when the crown prince ascends the throne. We will here erect a
      kingdom of the future, and it is all-important to lay so secure a
      corner-stone in the heart of his highness that nothing can shake or
      dislodge it. Who could perfect this work if we were not here? Who would
      dare to undertake the difficult task if we should fail? Who would carry on
      a secret and continued warfare with this artful and powerful seductress if
      we were conquered?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one would do it,&rdquo; sighed Woellner, &ldquo;no one would sacrifice themselves
      like Samson for this Delilah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will together be the Samson,&rdquo; replied Bischofswerder, drawing a glass
      of sparkling champagne. &ldquo;We will be the Samson which the Philistines drove
      out, but this woman shall not practise the arts of Delilah upon us in
      putting our eyes out or cutting off our hair. Against two Samsons the most
      artful and beautiful Delilah is not wary enough; and if we cannot conquer
      her, we must resort to other means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What may they be, dear brother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must compromise the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Woellner sprang up, and a flush of anger or from champagne overspread his
      face &ldquo;Compromise with the sinful creature!&rdquo; he cried, impetuously. &ldquo;Make
      peace with the seductress, who leads the prince from the path of virtue!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we must be on friendly terms with this woman, who could greatly
      injure us as an enemy, and aid us infinitely as a friend. This is my
      intention, and I am the more convinced that we must accept this middle
      course, as she is protected by the king.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he knows from his spies that she mingles with the Illuminati and
      the Freemasons, and that she is our opponent,&rdquo; said Woellner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The more the reason, my noble zealot, to win her friendship, who will
      have validity and power until the crown prince reigns, and this old
      godless freethinker of a king is in his gravel Then Prussia will commence
      a new era, and we shall be lords, and guide the machine of state. For such
      lofty aims one ought to be ready to compromise with his Satanic majesty
      even. Then why not with this little she-devil, whose power is fading every
      year with her youth and beauty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite true, we should be mindful of the device of our Invisible
      Fathers. The end sanctifies the means,&rdquo; sighed Woellner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it to be indispensable, and you will grant that I am right. Do
      you not see that the prince has availed himself of our absence to go
      there, and has not yet returned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; shrieked Woellner, clasping his hands&mdash;&ldquo;you do not mean that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Rinaldo has returned to the enchanted garden of Armida.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, let us hasten to release him at once, and revue his soul from
      perdition!&rdquo; cried Woellner, springing up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, let us await him here without a word of reproach upon
      his return. This will touch his tender heart which we must work upon, if
      we would get him into our power, for to us he must belong. Fill our
      glasses with the sparkling wine, and drink to the contract with Wilhelmine
      Enke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as merrily they quaffed the champagne in the little cosy dining-room
      at Charlottenburg, where the prince and Wilhelmine were rejoicing over a
      reconciliation, no one being present but the two children. Their joyous
      laugh and innocent jests delighted the father, and the beaming eyes, sweet
      smile, and witty conversation of his favorite, filled his heart with
      pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word of reproach escaped her, but exultant and joyous she hastened
      with outstretched arms to meet him, kissing away all his attempts to
      implore pardon, and thanking him that he had returned to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the prince gave himself up to the joy of the reunion with his
      beloved Wilhelmine sad children; but now, as the first outburst had
      passed, the quiet, happy dinner being finished, and they had returned to
      the sitting-room, a tinge of melancholy earnestness overshadowed his
      amiable face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmine threw her arms gently around his neck as she sat beside him
      upon the divan, and looked up to him with a tender questioning glance.
      &ldquo;Your thoughts are veiled, dearest; will you not confide to me that which
      lies concealed there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Wilhelmine, it is a mourning veil, and hides the sorrow of
      renunciation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not understand you, Frederick,&rdquo; she smilingly replied. &ldquo;Who could
      compel you to an abnegation which would cause you grief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Wilhelmine, and understand that I am suffering from
      circumstances&mdash;an oath taken in the pressure of the moment. Try to
      comprehend me, my dear child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drawing her closer to him, he faithfully related to her the night of the
      communion of the spirits, and his consequent oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all, my dear?&rdquo; she replied, smiling, as he finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing more than I would know if you have only sworn to renounce
      Wilhelmine Enke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What could I have done more prejudicial to you?&rdquo; he cried, not a little
      irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you could not injure or grieve me more, and therefore I am not a
      little surprised that the pious Fathers could so carelessly word their
      oaths. You have sworn to renounce your affection to and separate from
      Wilhelmine Enke; so it follows that the Invisibles only demand that you
      give up my name, not myself, and that is easily changed, and my dear
      prince will not become a perjurer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not quite understand you; but I perceive by the arch expression of
      your face that you have conceived a lucky escape for your unhappy
      Frederick William. Explain to me, dearest, your meaning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must change my name by marrying some one!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marry! and I give you to another? I will never consent to that,&rdquo; he
      cried, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to a husband, only a name,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;These Rosicrucians are such
      extraordinarily virtuous and pure beings, loving you so infinitely and
      disinterestedly, that it grieves them that my love for you does not shun
      the light, and throw over itself the mantle of hypocritical virtue! We
      will yield to the zealous purity of the Rosicrucians,&rdquo; continued
      Wilhelmine, her eyes sparkling, &ldquo;and wrap this Wilhelmine Enke in a mantle
      of virtue by giving her a husband; and then, when she walks out with her
      children the passers-by will not have to blush with shame, and cry, &lsquo;There
      goes the miss with her children!&rsquo; I have conceived and planned during this
      long and painful separation, and I am resolved to submit humbly to the
      pious Fathers, who are so zealously watchful for the salvation of your
      soul and my good fame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is to say, you are determined to snap your fingers at them! Your
      plan is a good one, but you will find no one to aid you in a sham
      marriage!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have already found one,&rdquo; whispered Wilhelmine, smiling. &ldquo;Your valet de
      chambre Rietz is willing to stand with me in a sham marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My body-servant!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Frederick William! You will confess that I am not ambitious, and
      only consent to it to secure our happiness from the persecution of these
      virtuous men. Here is the contract,&rdquo; said she, drawing from her
      dress-pocket a paper, which she unfolded. &ldquo;He promises to give me his
      name, and regard me as a stranger always, for the sum of four hundred
      thalers annually, with the promise of promotion to confidential servant
      when the noble crown prince shall ascend the throne. <i>[Footnote:
      Historical.&mdash;See F. Forster, &ldquo;Latest Prussian History,&rdquo; vol. 1., p.
      74.]</i> Will you sign it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do any thing that will grant me your affection, in spite of my
      unhappy oath. Give me the paper. I will sign it. When is the wedding?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The moment that you, my dear lord and master, have inscribed your name,&rdquo;
       said Wilhelmine, handing him the pen, and pointing to the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince wrote the desired signature, quickly throwing the pen across
      the room, shouting, &ldquo;Long live Wilhelmine Rietz, who has rescued me from
      perjury and sin! Come to my arms, outstretched to press to my heart the
      most beautiful, most intelligent, and most diplomatic of women!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two days later it was related in Berlin that Wilhelmine Enke had married
      the princely valet de chambre Rietz, the crown prince being present at the
      ceremony, which took place at a small village near Potsdam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the head of marriages, the Berlin newspapers announced &ldquo;Wilhelmine
      Enke to Carl Rietz.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my Rosicrucians,&rdquo; cried Wilhelmine, laughingly, as she read this
      notice, a mischievous triumph sparkling in her eyes; &ldquo;ah, my heroes in
      virtue, for once you are outwitted, and I am victorious! I would like to
      witness their surprise. How they will laugh and swear over it! The
      favorite of a prince married to a valet de chambre! Wait until the prince
      becomes a king, then Wilhelmine Rietz will develop into a beautiful
      butterfly, and the wife of the valet de chambre will become a countess&mdash;nay,
      a princess. The Great Kophta has promised it, and he shall keep his word.
      I wear his ring, which sparkles and glistens, although the jeweller
      declares the diamond has been exchanged for a false stone. No matter, if
      it only shines like the real one. Every thing earthly is deception,
      falsehood, and glitter. Every one is storming and pressing on in savage
      eagerness toward fortune, honor, and fame! I will have my part in it. The
      storm and pressure of the world rage in my own heart. The fire of ambition
      is lighted in my soul, and the insatiable thirst for fortune consumes me.
      Blaze and burn until the day that Frederick William ascends the throne;
      then the low-born daughter of the trumpeter will become the high-born
      countess. The false stone will change to the sparkling diamond and
      Cagliostro shall then serve me.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXXVIII. REVENGE FULFILLED.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Since the soiree at the house of the rich banker, Ebenstreit, an entire
      winter had passed in pleasures and fetes. The position of Baron Ebenstreit
      von Leuthen had been recognized in aristocratic society, thanks to his
      dinners, soirees, balls, fetes, and particularly to his lovely, spirited,
      and proud wife. Herr Ebenstreit von Leuthen had reached the acme of his
      ambition; his house was the resort of the most distinguished society; the
      extravagance and superb arrangements of his dinners and fetes were the
      theme of every tongue. This excessive admiration flattered the vain,
      ambitious parvenu extremely, and it was the happiest day of his life when
      Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of Frederick the Great, did him the
      unspeakable honor to dine with him. This gratifying day he owed to his
      wife, and, as he said, it ought to be kept as the greatest triumph of
      money over prejudice and etiquette&mdash;the day upon which a royal prince
      recognized the rich and newly-created noble as his equal. Ebenstreit&rsquo;s
      entrance into the highest circle of aristocracy was due to the management
      and tone of the world of his wife, who understood the elegancies of life,
      passing as an example and ideal of an elegant woman, of which her husband
      was very proud. He lauded his original and crafty idea of devoting his
      money to such a satisfactory purchase as a sensible and ladylike wife,
      although the union was not a happy one, and, in the proper acceptation of
      the word, no marriage at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst all were entertained at the fetes, and envied the splendor and
      wealth of Baron von Ebenstreit, there were many sinister remarks as to the
      possibility of sustaining this expenditure upon such a grand scale. It was
      whispered about that the banking-house, conducted under another name, had
      lost in extensive speculations, and that the baron lived upon his
      principal instead of his interest. The business community declared that
      the firm entered into the most daring and senseless undertakings, and that
      it must go to ruin. The old book-keeper, Splittgerber, who had for many
      years conducted the business, had been pensioned by the baron, and
      commenced for himself. His successor had once ventured to warn the
      nobleman, and represent to him the danger which threatened him, for which
      he was immediately dismissed, and the fact communicated to the entire
      house, at a special assemblage of the clerks for the purpose, with the
      warning of a like fate for every subordinate who should presume to
      criticise the acts of the principals, or proffer advice to them. Since
      this no one had ventured to repeat the offence, but every member of the
      house occupied himself in drawing a profit from the general and daily
      increasing confusion, and save something from the wreck which would
      inevitably ensue. The baron, with pretentious unconcern, dazzled by his
      unusual honors, permitted his business affairs to take their course with
      smiling unconcern, and when unsuccessful, to hide the mistakes of the
      banker under the pomp of the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie, indulging in the style of a great lady, appeared not to notice or
      trouble herself at all about these things. She entertained most
      luxuriantly, and spent enormous sums upon her toilet, changed the costly
      livery of her numerous retinue of servants every month, as well as the
      furniture of the drawing-rooms; and presented with generous liberality her
      superfluous ornaments, dresses, and furniture to her dear high-born
      friends, who greedily accepted them, and were overflowing in their tender
      protestations and gratitude, whilst they in secret revolted at the
      presumption of the arrogant woman, who permitted herself to send them her
      cast-off things.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rejoiced to receive them, however, and reappeared in her splendid
      drawing-rooms, enduring the pride and neglect of the baroness, and calling
      her their dear friend, whom they in secret envied and hated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Marie know this, or did she let herself be deceived by these friendly
      protestations? Occasionally, when her friends embraced and kissed her, a
      languid smile flitted over her haughty face; and once as she wandered
      through the suite of rooms, awaiting her guests, she caught the reflection
      of a beautiful woman in the costly Venetian mirrors, sparkling with
      diamonds and wearing a silver-embroidered dress with a train. She gazed at
      this woman with an expression of ineffable scorn, and whispered to her:
      &ldquo;Suffer yet awhile, you shall soon be released. This miserable trash will
      disappear. Only be firm&mdash;I hear already the cracking of the house
      which will soon fall a wreck at your feet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Others heard it also. As preparations were being made for a grand dinner,
      with which the Baron and Baroness von Ebenstreit would close the season,
      the former head bookkeeper of the baron appeared at the palace, demanding,
      with anxious mien, to see the principal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at the moment the baron and his wife were in the large
      reception-room, which the decorator was splendidly arranging, under the
      direction of the baroness, with flowers, festoons, columns, and statues.
      Ebenstreit was watching admiringly the tasteful and costly display as the
      footman announced the former book-keeper and present banker, Splittgerber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must come at another time,&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit, impatiently, &ldquo;I am busy
      now; I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, baron,&rdquo; replied an earnest, gentle voice behind him, &ldquo;that I
      have followed the lackey and entered unbidden. I come on urgent business,
      and I must indeed speak with you instantly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be brief then, at least,&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit, peevishly. &ldquo;You see that my
      wife is here, and we are very busy arranging for a grand dinner to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herr Splittgerber, instead of replying, cast a peculiarly sad, searching
      glance through the beautifully-adorned room, and at the two lackeys, who
      stood on each side of the wide folding-doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit that these servants withdraw, and order them to close the doors,&rdquo;
       said the book-keeper, almost commandingly. Ebenstreit, overruled by the
      solemn earnestness, obeyed against his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like me to leave also, sir?&rdquo; said Marie, with a calm, haughty
      manner. &ldquo;You have only to ask it and the baron will, undoubtedly, accord
      your request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I beg you to remain,&rdquo; quietly replied Splittgerber, &ldquo;for
      what I have to say concerns you and your husband equally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, I beg you to say it quickly,&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit, impatiently;
      &ldquo;I repeat, that we are very busy with preparing for to-day&rsquo;s festival.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not give any fete to-day,&rdquo; said Splittgerber, solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit, cringing and frightened, gazed at the old man who looked sadly
      at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baroness laughed aloud, sneeringly. &ldquo;My dear sir, your tone and manner
      remind me of the wicked spirit at the horrible moment in the story when he
      comes to demand the bartered soul, and the enchanted castle falls a
      wreck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your comparison is an apt one, baroness,&rdquo; sighed the old man.&mdash;&ldquo;I
      came to you, baron, because I loved your father. I have served your house
      thirty years, and amassed the little I had to commence business with in
      your service. Moreover, when you so suddenly dismissed me, you not only
      gave me my salary as a pension, but you funded the annuity with a
      considerable sum, which makes me, through your house, independent in
      means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may thank my wife for that. She demanded, when I dismissed you, that
      I should compensate you with the liberality of a true nobleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, would that you had not done it, baroness!&rdquo; cried Splittgerber&mdash;&ldquo;would
      that you had permitted the old faithful pioneer in the business to remain
      by your husband! He might have warded off this misfortune and saved you by
      his experience and advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For this very reason I demanded your removal. You permitted yourself to
      proffer advice which I felt did not become you,&rdquo; replied Marie, with a
      strange smile of triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, I repeat, would that you had not done it!&rdquo; sighed the old man. &ldquo;I
      came to warn you, to conjure you, to save yourselves&mdash;to flee while
      there is yet time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mercy! what has happened?&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit, terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The banking-house of Ebenstreit, founded under the name of Ludwig,
      associated with Ehlert of Amsterdam, four months since, to buy and load
      ships for the Calcutta market. Herr Ebenstreit gathered together the last
      wrecks of his fortune remaining from his ruinous speculations, to win
      enormously in this investment. Besides, he indorsed the notes of the
      Amsterdam house for the sum of eighty thousand dollars, which has been
      drawn, so that their notes are protested there. Herr Ebenstreit will have
      to pay this sum!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else?&rdquo; asked Ebenstreit, almost breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house of Ehlert, in Amsterdam, has failed; the principal has fled
      with the coffers; the notes for eighty thousand dollars were protested,
      and you, baron, must pay this sum to-day, or declare yourself a bankrupt,
      and go to prison for debt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instantaneously a suppressed cry and a laugh were heard. Ebenstreit sank
      upon a seat, concealing his pallid face with his hands, while Marie stood
      at his side, her face beaming with joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am lost, I do not possess the eighth part of that sum! I cannot pay it.
      I must submit, for there are no further means to prevent it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Marie, with haughty tranquillity, &ldquo;you have no further means
      to prevent it. The rich banker Ebenstreit will leave this house, no longer
      his own, to enter the debtor&rsquo;s prison poor as a beggar&mdash;nay, worse, a
      defrauder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how cruel you are!&rdquo; groaned Ebenstreit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you say, baroness, that this house is no longer his?&rdquo; asked
      Splittgerber, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she triumphantly cried. &ldquo;It belongs to me, and all that is in it&mdash;the
      pictures, statues, silver, diamonds, and pearls. Oh, I am still a rich
      woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you mean to retain this wealth if your husband becomes bankrupt?
      Do you not possess a common interest?&rdquo; asked Splittgerber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank Heaven, the community of interest was given up a year since,&rdquo;
       cried Ebenstreit, joyfully. &ldquo;Baroness von Ebenstreit is the lawful
      possessor of this house and furniture. I was not so indiscreet as you
      supposed. I have at least secured this to my wife, and she will be a rich
      woman even if I fail, and will not let me starve. I shall divide about ten
      per cent with my creditors, but my wife will be rich enough for us both.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This gives me to understand that you intend to make a fraudulent
      bankruptcy. You have settled every thing upon your wife to save yourself
      from the unhappy consequences of your failure. You will still be a rich
      man if your wife should sell her house, works of art, diamonds, gold and
      silver service, and equipages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, a very rich man,&rdquo; said Marie. &ldquo;In the last few weeks I have
      had my property estimated, and it would at least bring three hundred
      thousand dollars.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the baron only possessed this, he could pay his creditors, and have a
      small amount over, sufficient to live upon economically and genteelly. But
      you would rather enjoy splendor, and are not particular about living
      honorably. You will undoubtedly sell your property, and go to Paris, to
      revel in luxury and pleasure, while your defrauded creditors may, through
      you come to poverty and want.&mdash;Baron, I now see that your wife did
      well to bring about my removal. I should have, above all things, given you
      the unwelcome advice to sustain your honor unblemished, and dispose of
      your costly surroundings for the benefit of your creditors, that when you
      die it may be with a clear conscience. You prefer a life of luxury and
      ease, rocking your conscience to sleep until God will rouse it to a
      fearful awaking. But do as you like. I came here to offer you assistance,
      thinking that you would dispose of this property, and after paying your
      creditors have sufficient to live upon. Then I could be permitted to prove
      my fidelity to you. I now see that I was a fool. Yet in parting I will
      still beg of you to avoid the unfavorable impression of this dinner. The
      bill of exchange will be presented at four o&rsquo;clock, and the bearer will
      not be satisfied with the excuse of your non-payment on account of
      dinner-company. You will be obliged to settle at once or be arrested. I
      have learned this from your chief creditor, and I begged him to have
      forbearance for you. I shall now justify him in showing you none, as you
      do not deserve it!&mdash;Farewell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old book-keeper turned with a slight nod, and strode away through the
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you nothing to say to him? Will you let him go thus?&rdquo; asked Marie,
      impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all. What should I say?&rdquo; he replied, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will speak with him.&rdquo; Marie called loudly after Splittgerber,
      saying, &ldquo;I have a word to speak to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The book-keeper remained standing near the door, and turning with downcast
      face, demanded of Marie what she wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to tell you,&rdquo; she replied, with her usual tranquil,
      proud demeanor, approaching Splittgerber, who regarded her with severity
      and contempt, which she met with a gentle, friendly expression, a sweet
      smile hovering on her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie came close up to the old man, who awaited her with haughty defiance,
      and never advanced one step to meet her&mdash;a lady splendidly bedecked
      with diamonds and gold-embroidered satin. She whispered a few words in his
      ear. He started, and, astonished, looked into her face, as if questioning
      what he heard. She nodded, smiling, and bent again to say a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Splittgerber seemed metamorphosed. His gloomy face brightened a
      little, and his insolent glance was changed to one of deep emotion, Bowing
      profoundly as he held the baroness&rsquo;s proffered hand to take leave, he
      pressed it most respectfully to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will return in an hour?&rdquo; Marie asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I shall seek the gentlemen, and bring them with me,&rdquo; he graciously
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks; I will then await you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Splittgerber departed, and Marie returned to Ebenstreit who, amazed,
      muttered some unintelligible words, having listened to her mysterious
      conversation with the old book-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now to you, sir!&rdquo; said she, her whole tone and manner changing to harsh
      command; &ldquo;the hour for settling our accounts has arrived&mdash;the hour
      that I have awaited, purchasing it by four years of torture,
      self-contempt, and despair. This comedy is at an end. I will buy of you my
      freedom. Do you hear me? I will cast off these galley-chains. I will be
      free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marie!&rdquo; he cried, retreating in terror, &ldquo;with what fearful
      detestation you regard me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you wonder at it? Have I ever concealed this hate from you, or ever
      given you hope to believe that a reconciliation would be possible between
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, truly you have not, but now you will forgive me, for you know how I
      love you, and have provided for your future. You will remain rich, and I
      shall be poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie regarded him with unspeakable contempt. &ldquo;You are more despicable
      than I thought you were. You do not deserve forbearance or pity, for you
      are a dishonorable bankrupt, who cares not how much others may suffer,
      provided his future is secured. I will not, however, suffer the name which
      I have borne against my will, to be defamed and become a mark for scorn. I
      will compel you to remain an honest man, and be just to your creditors. I
      propose to pay the bills of exchange, which will be presented to you
      to-day, provided you will consent to my conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marie, you are an angel!&rdquo; he cried, rushing toward her and kneeling
      at her feet, &ldquo;I will do all that you wish, and consent to every thing you
      propose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you swear it?&rdquo; she coldly replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear that I accept your conditions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring the writing-materials from the window-niche, and seat yourself by
      this table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit brought them, and seated himself by the Florentine mosaic
      table, near which Marie was standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew from her pocket a paper, which she unfolded and placed before him
      to sign. &ldquo;Sign this with your full name, and add, &lsquo;With my own free will
      and consent,&rsquo;&rdquo; she commandingly ordered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will first make known to me the contents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have sworn to sign it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and unless you accept my
      conditions, you are welcome to be incarcerated for life in the debtor&rsquo;s
      prison. You have only to choose. If you decide in the negative, I will
      exert myself that your creditors do not free you. I should trust in the
      justice of God having sent you there, and that man in miserable pity
      should not act against His will in freeing you. Now decide; will you sign
      the paper, or go to prison as a dishonorable bankrupt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hastily seized the pen and wrote his name, handing the paper to Marie,
      sighing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten to add the clause, &lsquo;With my own free will and
      consent,&rsquo;&rdquo; she replied, hastily glancing at it, letting the paper drop
      like a wilted leaf, and her eyes flashing with scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit saw it, and as he again handed her the paper, he exclaimed, &ldquo;I
      read in your eyes the intense hate you bear me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she replied, composedly, &ldquo;not only hate, but scorn. Hush! no
      response. You knew it long before I was forced to stand at the altar with
      you. I warned you not to unite yourself to me, and you had the impious
      audacity to defy me with your riches. The seed of hate which you then
      sowed, you may to-day reap the fruits of. You shall recognize now that
      money is miserable trash, and that when deprived of it you will never win
      sympathy from your so-called friends, but they will turn from you with
      contempt, when you crave their pity or aid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that you exaggerate, dearest,&rdquo; said Ebenstreit, fawningly. &ldquo;You
      have many devoted friends among the ladies, and I can well say that I have
      found, among the distinguished gentlemen who visit our house, many noble,
      excellent ones who have met me with a warmth of friendship&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they would borrow money of the rich man,&rdquo; interrupted Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course my coffers have always been accessible to my dear friends, and
      I prized the honor of proving my friendship by my deeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will realize to-day how they prove their gratitude to you for it. Go,
      receive the good friends whom you have invited. It is time that they were
      here, and I perceive the carriages are approaching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie motioned to the door, with a dictatorial wave of her hand, and
      Ebenstreit betook himself to the reception-room. Just as he crossed the
      threshold, the usher announced &ldquo;Herr Gedicke! Ebenstreit greeted him
      hastily in passing, and the old man went on to meet the baroness, who was
      hastening toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have most graciously invited me to your house to-day, and you will
      excuse me that my earnest wish to see you has brought me earlier than any
      other guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begged you to come a quarter of an hour sooner, for I would gladly
      speak with you alone a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so, and hastened up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not my old Trude go to see you some days since?&rdquo; asked Marie,
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did, and you can well understand that I was much affected and
      surprised at her visit. I thought that you had forgotten me, baroness, and
      that every souvenir of the past had fled from your memory. I now see that
      your noble, faithful heart can never forget, and therefore has never
      ceased to suffer, which I ought to regret, for your sake, but for my own
      it pleased me to receive your kind greeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie pressed her hand to her eyes and sighed audibly. &ldquo;Pray do not speak
      so gently to me&mdash;it enervates me, and I would force myself to endure
      to-day. Only tell me, did Trude communicate to you my wishes, and will it
      be possible for you to fulfil them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your brave, good friend brought me a thousand dollars, praying me to
      convey this to Herr Moritz in order to defray the expenses of a journey to
      Italy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you accomplished it, and in such a manner that he does not suspect
      the source from whence it came? He would not receive it if he had the
      least suspicion of it. I have seen him secretly several times as he passed
      to and fro from the Gymnasium, and he appeared to me to grow paler and
      more languid every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that since you have come back he has changed. The old
      melancholy seems to have returned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He needs distraction; he must go away and forget me. It has always been
      his earnest wish to travel in Italy. You must tell him that you have
      succeeded in getting the money for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bethought myself of Moritz&rsquo;s publisher, represented to him how
      necessary it was for the health of Professor Moritz to travel, begged of
      him to order a work upon Italy, and particularly the works of art of Rome,
      and propose to Moritz the acceptance of the money for that object, as he
      was quite too proud to receive it as a present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was an excellent idea,&rdquo; cried Marie. &ldquo;Has it been accomplished?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, as Herr Maurer made the proposal, and Moritz replied, sighing, that
      he had not the means for such a journey, the publisher immediately offered
      him half of the remuneration in advance; consequently he starts to-morrow
      for Italy, unknowing of the thousand dollars being your gift.&rdquo; <i>[Footnote:
      This work, which was published after his return, still excites the highest
      interest, and is entitled &ldquo;Travels of a German in Italy during 1786 and
      1787.&mdash;Letters of Philip Carl Moritz,&rdquo; 8 vols., Berlin, published by
      Frederick Maurer.]</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much I thank you!&rdquo; she joyfully cried. &ldquo;Moritz is saved; he will now
      recover, and forget all his grief in studying the objects of interest in
      the Eternal City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really believe that?&rdquo; asked Herr Gedicke. &ldquo;Were you not also in
      Italy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was indeed there two years, but it was very different with me. It is
      difficult to forget you are a slave, when listening all the while to the
      clanking of your chains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child, I read with sorrow the history of the past years in your
      grief-stricken face. It is the first time we have met since your
      marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See what these years have made of me!&mdash;a miserable wife, whom the
      world esteems, but who recoils from herself. My heart has changed to
      stone, and I feel metamorphosed. The sight of you recalls that fearful
      hour, melting my heart and causing the tears to flow. At that time you
      blessed me, my friend and father. Oh, grant me your blessing again in this
      hour of sorrow! I implore you for it, before an important decision! I long
      for the sympathy of a noble soul!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know not, my child, with what grief this hour may be laden for you; but
      I lay my hand again upon your head, imploring God in His divine mercy to
      sustain you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Countess von Moltke and Frau von Morien!&rdquo; announced the usher. In
      brilliant toilets the ladies rustled in, hastening toward the baroness,
      who had now regained her wonted composure, and received them in her usual
      stately manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How perfectly charming you look to-night!&rdquo; cried Countess Moltke. &ldquo;To me
      you are ever the impersonation of the goddess of wealth and beauty
      strewing everywhere with lavish generosity your gifts, and turning every
      thing to gold with your touch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whose heart has remained tender and gentle,&rdquo; added Frau von Morien.&mdash;&ldquo;You
      are indeed a goddess, always enhancing the pleasures of others. To-day I
      wear the beautiful bracelet which you sent me because I admired it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I, ma toute belle,&rdquo; cried the countess, &ldquo;have adorned myself with
      this superb gold brocade which you so kindly had sent from Paris for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have forgotten, countess, that you begged of me to give the order for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that is true! Then I am your debtor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are not too proud to receive it as a present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, most certainly not; on the contrary, I thank you, my dear.&mdash;Tell
      me, my dear Morien, is not this woman an angel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the French ambassador, Marquis Treves, appeared among the
      numerous guests, whom the baroness stepped quickly forward to welcome,
      withdrawing with him into the window-niche.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Welcome, marquis,&rdquo; she said, quickly, in a low voice, &ldquo;Have you brought
      me the promised papers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Drawing a sealed packet from his coat-pocket, he handed it to the baroness
      with a low bow, saying: &ldquo;I would draw your attention to the fact once
      more, dear madam, that I have abided by the price named by yourself, in
      making this sale, although I am still of the opinion that it is below its
      value.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sum is sufficient for my wants, and I rated its value according as it
      is taxed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are a hundred thousand dollars in bills of exchange, payable at the
      French embassy at any moment,&rdquo; said the marquis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, sir, for this proof of friendly attention; and as it may be
      the last time we meet, I would assure you that I shall always remember
      your many and thoughtful kindnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak, baroness, as if you would forsake the circle of which you are
      the brightest ornament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the friends will forsake me,&rdquo; she replied, with a peculiar smile.
      &ldquo;Ere an hour shall pass not one of all these numerous guests will remain
      here.&mdash;Ah, there comes the decision! See there, marquis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The usher announced &ldquo;Banker Splittgerber.&rdquo; The old man entered followed by
      two men of not very presentable appearance, and whose toilet was but
      little in keeping with the brilliantly-decorated room and the aristocratic
      guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never heeding the sneers nor contemptuous smiles, the faithful book-keeper
      wound his way, through the crowd of elegantly dressed ladies and
      gentlemen, accompanied by the two men, up to Ebenstreit, who, with
      instinctive politeness, had placed himself near Marie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Splittgerber, in a loud voice, &ldquo;this is Baron Ebenstreit
      von Leuthen, principal of the banking-house Ludwig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen approached, one of them saying, &ldquo;They sent us here from
      your office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is not the place for business,&rdquo; replied Ebenstreit. &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, gentlemen, remain here,&rdquo; cried Marie. &ldquo;Our guests present are such
      intimate, devoted friends that we have nothing to conceal from them; but
      on the contrary, I am convinced they will only be too happy of the
      occasion to prove their friendship, of which they have so often assured
      us.&mdash;These gentlemen demand the payment of a bill of exchange for
      eighty thousand dollars. Take my portfolio, Ebenstreit; there is a pencil
      in it. Go around and make a collection; undoubtedly the entire sum will be
      soon noted down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ebenstreit approached the Baron von Frankenstein, saying: &ldquo;Pardon me if I
      recall to your memory the sum of one thousand louis d&rsquo;ors, due for four
      black horses three months since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; cried the baron, &ldquo;this is a strange manner to collect one&rsquo;s
      debts. We were invited to a feast, and a pistol is pointed at us,
      demanding our debts to be cancelled!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange! How ridiculous!&rdquo; heard one here and there among the guests,
      as they, with one accord, pressed toward the door to make their exit,
      which they found fastened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remain,&rdquo; cried Marie, with stately dignity. &ldquo;I wish you honored guests to
      be witness of this scene in the hour of justification, as you were also
      present at the one when one of the noblest and best of men cursed me.&mdash;Banker
      Splittgerber, take these bills of exchange for one hundred thousand
      dollars. Pay these gentlemen, and devote the remainder to the other debts
      as far as it will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the three men withdrew by a side-drier, Marie exclaimed: &ldquo;I will now
      explain to you that Baron von Leuthen is ruined&mdash;poor as a beggar
      when he will not work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit, terrified, rushing toward her, and seizing her
      by the arm. &ldquo;Marie&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw off his hand from her in anger. &ldquo;Do not touch me, sir, and do
      not presume either to address me with any endearments. You have yourself
      said that our marriage was not a veritable one, but was like the union of
      associates in business, and now I would inform you it is dissolved: the
      one is a bankrupt; the other a woman whom you cursed, and who reclaims of
      you four years of shame and degradation. You wonder at my speaking thus,
      but you do not know this man, my friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke, a door opened at the farther end of the room, and Trude
      entered in her simple dress, followed by Philip Moritz. Unobserved the two
      glided behind the charming grotto which had been arranged with flowers and
      wreaths in one of the niches. Every eye was turned upon the pale, stately
      beauty, erect in the centre of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay here, for no one can see us,&rdquo; whispered Trude. &ldquo;I could not bear to
      have you leave Berlin without hearing the justification of my dear Marie,
      and may God pardon me for letting you come here unbeknown to her! Listen,
      and pray to Him to forgive you the great injustice that you have done her.
      Be quiet, that no one may see you, and Marie be angry with her old Trude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Marie, with chilling contempt, &ldquo;you should know this man
      before whom you have all bowed, pressed the hand, and called your friend,
      because he was rich, and, thanks to his wealth alone, became a titled man&mdash;a
      baron, buying the hand of a poor but noble maiden, whom he knew despised
      him, and passionately loved another, having sworn eternal constancy to
      him. I am that young girl. I begged, nay implored him, not to pursue me,
      but he was void of pity, mocked my tears, and said he could buy my love,
      and my heart would at last be touched by the influence of his wealth. I
      should have preferred to die, but Fate ordered that the one I loved, by my
      fault, should by imprisonment atone our brief dream of bliss. I could only
      save him by accepting this man; these were the conditions. I became his
      wife before the world, and took my oath in his presence to revenge myself,
      and after four years I shall accomplish it. I have spent his money, and of
      the rich man made a beggar. God be praised, I can now revenge myself in
      freeing myself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free yourself? It is not true! You are my wife still,&rdquo; replied
      Ebenstreit, alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A radiant smile flitted over Marie&rsquo;s face as she defied Ebenstreit with
      the law of the Great Frederick, who had decided that every unhappy couple
      without offspring could separate by their own free will and consent,
      having signed a paper to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that the paper which you have made me sign?&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit,
      alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, drawn up by my notary, and both of our names are signed to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a fraud!&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit. &ldquo;I will protest against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it, and you will find it a vain effort. I promised to pay your debt if
      you would put your name to the document then placed before you, which you
      did. Ask the Marquis Treves how I paid your debts: he will answer you that
      he has given me the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the honor to pay to the baroness one hundred thousand dollars, as
      she rightly informs you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Marie, &ldquo;the marquis is the present possessor of this
      house and all that it contains&mdash;furniture, statues, and pictures;
      also the equipages and silver. To my mother I sent my diamonds, costly
      laces, and dresses, to indemnify her for the annuity which Herr von
      Ebenstreit settled upon her as purchase-money which he cannot pay, now
      that he is ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marquis,&rdquo; cried Ebenstreit, pale with anger, &ldquo;have you really bought this
      house and its contents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done so, and the one hundred thousand dollars the baroness has
      paid over to Herr Splittgerber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I am ruined,&rdquo; groaned Ebenstreit&mdash;&ldquo;I am lost!&rdquo; and, covering his
      face with his hands, he rushed from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie gazed at him with a sad expression, saying: &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,
      you now know to whom this house belongs. You can no longer say that I am
      the daughter whom the late General von Leuthen sold to a rich man. I am
      free!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a side-door opened, and Frau von Leuthen was heard saying
      to old Trude: &ldquo;Let me in! it is in vain to hold me back. I will have an
      explanation from my daughter, and learn what all this means.&rdquo; As she
      pushed herself into the room, she exclaimed: &ldquo;Ah, it is a fete day! There
      is the baroness in all her glory and splendor. She is not crazed, as I
      feared this morning, when she sent me all her ornaments and fine dresses
      and laces, with a note, sealed with black, inscribed upon it, &lsquo;Will Of the
      Baroness Ebenstreit von Leuthen.&rsquo; I opened it, and read: &lsquo;I give to my
      mother my precious ornaments, laces, and dresses, to secure to her the
      pension which she has lost.&mdash;Marie. &lsquo;I came here to learn if my
      daughter were dead, and what the conclusion of this lost pension may be,
      and I find&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find the confirmation of all that I wrote to you,&rdquo; replied Marie,
      coldly. &ldquo;Baron Ebenstreit von Leuthen is ruined. I have secured to you, in
      the sum which my jewels and laces will bring you, the annuity, so that you
      have not lost the money promised you for your daughter, and the marriage
      you have arranged has at least borne good fruit to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a cruel, ungrateful child,&rdquo; cried the mother. &ldquo;I have long known
      it, and rejected you from my heart, and from all shame I will yet protect
      the name you bear. I have just seen a sign in the Friedrich-strasse,
      &lsquo;Flower manufactory of Marie von Leuthen.&rsquo; What does this mean? Terrified,
      I stared speechless at these fearful words, and at the busy workmen
      preparing the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will explain it to you,&rdquo; cried Marie, with radiant mien. &ldquo;I have again
      become the flower-maker, and beg your favor, Countess von Moltke, Frau von
      Morien, and all the other ladies. I am free, and no longer the wife of a
      hated husband&mdash;no longer the distinguished and wealthy woman. All
      delusion and mockery have vanished. The costly dress and jewels that I now
      wear I will cast of from me as the last souvenir of the past.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Unclasping the diamond necklace and bracelets, she handed them to her
      mother, saying: &ldquo;Take them, and also this dress, the last finery I
      possess.&rdquo; She unloosed the band, and the long white satin train fell at
      her feet. Emerging from it as from a silvery cloud, she stood before them
      in a simple white dress, as she was clothed in her girlhood. &ldquo;Take them
      all,&rdquo; she joyfully cried. &ldquo;Take them, mother, it is all past. I am now
      myself again. Farewell, witnesses of this scene! I now quit your circle;
      and you, my mother, I forgive you; may the thoughts of your unhappy child
      never trouble you, waking or sleeping; may you forget that your daughter
      lives, and is wretched. Revenge has not softened my grief, or removed your
      curse from my head!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will lift it off your brow, Marie!&rdquo; cried Moritz, suddenly appearing
      from the window-niche, with beaming face and outstretched arms,
      approaching Marie, whom surprised and alarmed, retreated. &ldquo;Oh, noble,
      courageous woman, forgive me that I have been an unbidden witness to this
      scene, though by this means I now clearly recognize your strength of mind,
      and elevation of soul, and the wrong that I have committed in doubting and
      cursing you during these four years of gloom and despair. I bow before
      you, Marie, and implore you, upon my knees, to forgive me all the cruel,
      harsh words that I have uttered&mdash;that I have dared as a wretched fool
      to doubt you in this long night of despair. The day is dawning again upon
      us; a new sun will yet cheer us with its rays. Do not turn from me, but
      look at me, and grant me forgiveness.&mdash;My dear friend and father,
      speak for me, for you know what I have suffered. Beg of her to forgive
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marie,&rdquo; said the venerable old man, approaching her, gently putting his
      arm around her, &ldquo;God has willed that you, my poor, long-tried child,
      should pass through a season of extreme sorrow. You are now released, and
      all that belonged to you has vanished!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he signed to the guests to withdraw. Many had already escaped
      the painful scene by the side-door. Marie was now alone in the magnificent
      apartment, with Herr Gedicke and Moritz. She still stood, with concealed
      face, in the centre of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Marie,&rdquo; implored Moritz, &ldquo;hide not your dear face from me! Read in
      mine the deep grief of the past and the bliss of the future. I thank God
      that this unnatural union is severed, and that you are free. Be courageous
      to the end!&rdquo; Moritz impetuously drew her hand away, revealing her tearful
      countenance, as her head sank upon his shoulder. &ldquo;Can you not forgive me,
      Marie?&rdquo; he cried, with deep emotion. &ldquo;We have both wandered through a
      waste of grief, and now approach life radiant with happiness. Oh, speak to
      me, Marie; can you not love me and forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gazed into his eyes, and in their depths read that which gradually
      softened her hardened features, and caused a smile to play upon her lip.
      &ldquo;I love you dearly, devotedly; let this be our parting word. Go forth into
      the world, Moritz; my affection will follow you whithersoever you wander,
      and my soul will be true to you through all eternity, though we are
      forever separated. The poor wife, with her dismal retrospections, must not
      cast a shadow upon your future. Go, my beloved&mdash;Italy awaits you, and
      art will console you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me, dear Marie; only by your side am I happy. You are free and
      independent,&rdquo; cried Moritz.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; cried Marie, leaning upon the venerable old man, &ldquo;explain to
      him that I am still the wife of that hated man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is right, Philip; do not urge her further. She must first be legally
      separated, and this weary heart must have time to recover its wonted calm.
      Go to Italy, and confide your future and happiness to my care. Marie has
      lost a mother, but she shall find a father in me. I will watch over her
      until your return.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the door opened, and Trude entered. &ldquo;Every thing is ready; all
      the things which used to stand in the little garret-room are packed and
      sent to the manufactory. Shall we go, too, dear child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she cried, embracing the faithful old woman. &ldquo;Farewell, Philip&mdash;Italy
      calls you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go, but when I return will you not be my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marie gazed at Moritz, radiant with happiness, saying: &ldquo;The answer is
      engraven upon my heart. Return, and then I will joyfully respond to your
      love before God and man!&rdquo;
     </p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &ldquo;Project
Gutenberg&rdquo;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;
 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg&rdquo; is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
&ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original &ldquo;Plain Vanilla ASCII&rdquo; or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
